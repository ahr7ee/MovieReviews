      <text>Rightly or wrongly, they gave Tarantino hell for inspiring a raft of Reservoir Dogs
 knockoffs, all those mid-Nineties fast-talking, gun-loving crime capers du jour. I wonder then if anyone will finger Kevin Smith for providing the seedling for this rot. Clerks
 and Waiting �
 (set, natch, in the restaurant industry) share not only a premise based on the drudgery of the workplace, but also a flat visual style and a fixation on sex and all its attendant bodily fluids. But whereas Clerks
 was an inspired piece of raunch, Waiting �
 never aims higher than the urinal (indeed, one waiter�s inability to pee in public counts as a significant plot thread). The ostensible heart of the film is Dean (Long), a community-college dropout who�s seen his potential dwindle after years of service at a chain restaurant called Shenanigan�s. Dean�s lot isn�t so bad: Among his fellow waiters is his best pal, Monty (Two Guys and a Girl
�s ever-smirking Reynolds), whose defining character trait is a predilection for boning underage girls. Additionally, there�s the hot lesbian bartender (Chriqui), two wannabe-gangsta busboys (one of whom is played by cult darling Andy Milonakis), and a host of greasy-haired, loogey-shooting cooks (including Soderbergh favorite Luis Guzm�n, slumming) who pass the time by rubbing foodstuffs on their genitals and playing the "penis-showing game." The elaborate rules of that game boil down to � you got it � brandishing one�s penis (and, for extra points, one�s testicles) at unsuspecting coworkers. That�s about as funny as it gets in this frequently offensive and doggedly disgusting film. The acting hails strictly from the sitcom-school of delivery, the film is technically inept (certain stories appear to have been sliced and diced in the editing room), and the humor � in which the word "faggot" figures as 90% of the punchlines � traffics wholly in crude stereotypes. (Waiting �
 is not unlike solitary confinement with your 13-year-old little brother who may or may not be a latent homosexual � the theory going that boys who call other boys "fag" doth protest too much). While Waiting �
 does occasionally capture the in-the-trenches camaraderie of the service industry, mostly it serves as a 90-minute-long PSA on the dangers of enraging your waiter. And one last burning question: Were those stunt balls, or Guzm�n�s very own wagging at us?
