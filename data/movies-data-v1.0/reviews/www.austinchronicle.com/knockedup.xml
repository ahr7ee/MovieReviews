      <text>The attraction that exists between wisecracking, hirsute Jewish males and reserved, statuesque gentile females is one of Western civilization�s great wonders, a sociological anomaly that causes thousands of otherwise agnostic wisecracking, hirsute Jewish males to rush off to synagogue each year and give thanks. Ben Stone (Rogen) is such a male: a scruffy, round-faced, good-natured schlub who uses his deadpan wit as a defense mechanism against a world that often doesn�t put much stock in being scruffy or even good-natured. To give Ben some friendly cover, writer/director Apatow surrounds him with a juvenile band of like-minded slackers, played by actors from his cult-favorite TV shows Freaks &amp; Geeks
 and Undeclared
 and his 2005 movie, The 40 Year-Old Virgin
. (Like Preston Sturges, Apatow prefers the comfort of a stock company of comedy players.) Together they form a pack of disaffected modern-day Peter Pans who sidestep the responsibilities of adulthood by pretending they don�t exist, which isn�t hard to do when your brain is stuffed with marijuana smoke and movie trivia. Ben�s right at home in this shambolic world: He�s got the cleverest put-downs and the largest catalog of pop-culture knowledge, and he�s the most adept at using a gas-mask bong. So when he meets Alison (Heigl), a beautiful, blond, buxom, impossible dream of a woman, and unwittingly impregnates her during a one-night stand, it�s clear his introduction to the world of adult accountability is going to be messy. Like most of Apatow�s work, Knocked Up
 walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality, and though it�s extremely funny in bursts, the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act. The fault lies as much with Apatow�s casting as his writing. Rogen may have a gift for deadpan one-liners, but he doesn�t have the skills to carry a movie with this many emotional peaks and valleys: Laugh here, weep there; regress then, grow now; smoke this joint, raise that baby. It�s a heavy load for any actor to carry, much less a one-trick pony like Rogen. Interestingly, the actor who might have pulled off the role best was already a part of the cast: Rudd, who plays Alison�s brother-in-law, Pete, strikes a tone of snarky indifference and disappointed self-awareness that would have been a perfect fit for the reluctantly heroic Ben. As amusing as he may be, Rogen was born to be someone else�s comic sidekick.
