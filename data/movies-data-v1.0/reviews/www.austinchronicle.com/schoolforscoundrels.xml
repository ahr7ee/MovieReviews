      <text>While it�s not uncommon for Hollywood to completely defy the laws of probability, sometimes the absurdity of a misfire is so poignant as to demand attention. Case in point: School for Scoundrels
, a modern remake of a 1960 British satire. A film jam-packed with multitalented comedians (Cross, Silverman, Sanz, Stiller) would seem a slam-dunk opportunity for big laughs. I don�t know how they managed it, but School for Scoundrels
 is not only unfunny, it�s completely forgettable. Heder (Napoleon Dynamite)
 plays a shy and insecure meter maid named Roger. His career is essentially a one-note gag, resulting in a mild chuckle as he chugs along in his meter-mobile at 5 mph. But the chuckle quickly turns into a sigh when you realize there aren�t any good jokes coming any time soon. While Roger painfully pines for his fresh-faced neighbor, Amanda (Barrett), he lives a shadow of a life: mocked at work and incapable of keeping even his volunteer position as a Big Brother. Roger is clearly in need of a fix. Enter Thornton (Dr. P) and his extremist class for losers. Now, we�ve seen Billy Bob pull off some great performances and his turn in Bad Santa
 is inspired comedy. But in this sleepwalking turn, he clearly has no idea why he�s in this movie and is as eager to get through the experience as the audience will be. Roger enrolls in Dr. P�s supersecret confidence building class, which consists mostly of being yelled at by Thornton or harassed by his second-in-command (Duncan). Some of the supporting players provide a smile as the other class members in search of their "inner lion." But when the story escalates to a Roger vs. Dr. P battle for Amanda, the character development has been so minimal and the jokes so disappointing, it�s hard to muster an emotion or a laugh. Though Heder is mildly endearing, he should look into finding a new agent right quick. And before he�s asked to sign on for The Benchwarmers 2
. Co-writer/director Phillips, who thrives in testosterone-fueled comedy (Old School
, Road Trip)
, seems at a loss this go-around. While his previous films propelled themselves with whimsy and Will Ferrell, School for Scoundrels
 varies between taking itself seriously and not, leaving the viewer alternately confused and disappointed.
