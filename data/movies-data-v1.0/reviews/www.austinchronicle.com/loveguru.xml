      <text>Stop me if you�ve heard this one before: A Hindu mystic travels from India to Toronto to act as spiritual adviser to an African-American hockey player whose obsession with his ex-wife�s generously endowed, mustachioed Quebecois goalie boyfriend is endangering his team�s chances of winning the Stanley Cup. This mystic � the No. 2 professional guru in the world (behind Oprah favorite Deepak Chopra) and author of a whole library of pop self-esteem guides, including I Know You Are, but What Am I
 � revels in pseudo-religious psychobabble, clever wordplay (intimacy = into me I see), and ridiculous pop-culture references. Oh, and he wears a chastity belt with a carved-metal elephant codpiece, and he loves long jokes about diarrhea. In other words, the Guru Pitka is a creation of Mike Myers, the same fevered sketch-comedy mind that gave us Austin Powers, Wayne Campbell, and (king of them all) Dr. Evil. Like those characters, Pitka trafficks in humor that�s heavy on self-awareness (�I was ominous just then,� he informs one adversary after saying something � well � ominous), extended scatology (no one can stretch a gag about testicles like Myers can, not even if he or she wanted to), and convoluted puns that unpack themselves slowly and from a great distance. Unlike those characters, however, Pitka isn�t funny. Not even a little bit. Unlike Dr. Evil, who wasn�t afraid to be unlikable, Pitka�s schtick is one giant cry for acceptance � eccentric but not challenging, therapeutic but not cathartic � which is absolute death to comedy. This, I�m guessing, is why Myers surrounds himself with characters whose only responsibility is to laugh at Pitka�s jokes (the primary culprits being the criminally underused Malco and the criminally overused Alba, who may or may not be a cardboard cutout of a real girl): the better to ensure that audiences don�t drift away and lose the thread of hilarity. In the end, this desperation for approval absolutely buries The Love Guru
. This and the fact that it recycles gags from earlier and better Myers movies and hopes that the audience won�t notice because they�re too busy staring at Timberlake�s bursting Speedo. And then there�s the unshakeable sense that mocking self-help culture is a redundancy, like making fun of reality TV � or Republicans. Honestly, who needs Myers when you�ve got Chopra running around writing books with titles like SynchroDestiny
?
