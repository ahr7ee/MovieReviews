      <text>There�s not much to say about Mr. Bean�s Holiday
, a semisequel to 1997�s Bean
, which found Atkinson�s tweedy, semi-verbal-bungling Englishman abroad in Los Angeles. If you like the character � his tooty yellow Mini, his busily working beetle brows, his tendency to point and grunt and eat shellfish whole � then you will be rewarded with 88 minutes of such. If you are not a fan, Holiday
 will not win you. Not even with its references to Jacques Tati (the film�s salute to Jour de F�te
 is prominently featured in the trailer), not even with Bean�s French moppet of a traveling sidekick (Baldry), not even with the winsome young actress (de Caunes) with whom Bean has a thankfully chaste attraction. At the end of the day, it�s either funny when Bean chases a chicken to get back his bus ticket, or it isn�t, and you know where you stand. There�s a satirical bit about a gasbag film director (Dafoe) premiering a ponderous pic at Cannes, Bean�s holiday destination, and I did laugh at Bean disguised as an old woman. (It was the hat.) Certainly Atkinson�s flair for being Bean has not diminished, and he still has the timing and physical control necessary for a satisfying performance of the role at feature length � though some reports suggest Atkinson intends to retire the character after this film. But in the final analysis, this Holiday
 is a so-so late-summer diversion, unlikely to reignite Beanmania � or repeat the previous film�s boffo box office. It�s worth noting that longtime collaborator Richard Curtis is absent from the credits, and while the G rating correctly suggests that the film is inoffensive to children, that doesn�t mean they won�t be terrified when a father and son are separated in a train station, leaving the boy in childlike (and occasionally mean-spirited) Bean�s dubious care.
