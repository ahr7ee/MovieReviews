      <text>Yes, this is the new Woody Allen film widely hyped for a threesome, although it�s not the configuration as advertised in the ungainly title. Vicky (Hall, indefinable but intriguing) is the smart, sensible brunette and Cristina (Johansson) the amorous, free-thinking blonde; together, they are American best friends summering in Barcelona and falling, at a staggered clip, for a sultry Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Bardem). It sounds like the setup for a hot, sexy mess � and it might have been had Allen scrapped Vicky and Cristina to focus on the scenic glories of Gaud�s Barcelona and the twin headspin of Bardem and Cruz (who plays Juan Antonio�s brawling ex-wife, Maria Elena). But Allen�s take is too toothless, too bemused with the ever-shifting dynamics among the four players � shifts that often seem unmotivated, despite the near-constant narration (delivered by Christopher Evan Welch) that plainly announces them. That narration also carries the whiff of contempt for the American leads � although Cristina doesn't help herself when, tasked with the question of what she does for a living, she replies, �I�m currently at liberty.� (A well-heeled, unaccountably monied woman aching for male approval and artistic credibility by flopping from bed to bed, hobby to hobby, philosophy to philosophy? Gosh, Woody � haven�t seen that
 one before.) Muse or not, Johansson is done no favors here by Allen, and when sidled up to Cruz, who�s only gotten harder, sexier, and more bedazzling as she ages, the jejune actress � sorry, ingenue
 � amounts to not much more than a blinding blonde with a power pout. The real problem � as ever, in Allen�s latter years � is the glass-house remove that dogs his writing. Vicky Cristina Barcleona
 is by no means a bad film, but it�s irrefutable evidence that Allen has aged � or cloistered � himself into irrelevance. As non-native speakers, Bardem and Cruz � who have a corker of a scene in which they comfort each other, in Spanish, while being mutually dumped by the third leg of their m�nage � trois � manage the formal, stilted-sounding language believably, but something is terribly amiss when the American actors sound like English is their second language.
