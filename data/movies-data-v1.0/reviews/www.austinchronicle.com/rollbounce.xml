      <text>Despite a marketing campaign that appears bound and determined to make its subject look as grindingly dull as possible, Roll Bounce
 triumphs on almost all counts, hot-wiring a penchant for sports film clich�s to some seriously spot-on Seventies nostalgia that looks and feels true not only in its attention to period detail but also in its all-important portrayal of teenage camaraderie and its attendant angst. Young (but not L�il) Bow Wow plays Southside Chicago rollerskating champ X (short for Xavier), who, along with his trusty band of low-rent buddies, spends the summer of �78 mourning the recent death of his mother and the closing of his local skate palace by taking his A-game uptown and sticking it to the man. In this case, that would be the Rick Jamesian Sweetness (Jonathan) and his multiethnic coterie of pant-suited rollerballers, as unlikely a mix as the BeeGees at CBGB but almost assuredly as entertaining. Puppy love arrives in the form of Good�s all-grown-up girl-next-door Naomi, who hooks up with the endearingly reticent X at the behest of new-girl-on-the-block Sonya (Irvin), while X�s economically displaced dad (McBride) learns to love again even while the memory of his late wife still stings his eyes. At times, Roll Bounce
 feels as though it�s one long parade of coming-of-age film clich�s after another, but Malcolm Lee�s tight, focused direction, coupled with a disarmingly irony-free script from Beauty Shop
�s Norman Vance Jr. and some smart, funny performances from Wow and pals Khleo Thomas (as the mixed-race Mixed Mike), Troy (Paul Wesley), and Naps (Rick Gonzalez) help the film rise above any stereotyped profiling. Replete with nods to Seventies culture that go past the obvious (What�s Happening!!
 references) to the just plain cool (a poster of San Antonio Spurs legendary Iceman Gervin adorns X�s bedroom wall), Roll Bounce
 is the sort of teenage summer fare that just doesn�t get made that much anymore, a younger-skewing Hustle &amp; Flow
 that�d rest easy on the bottom half of a Car Wash
 drive-in double bill. Never mind the immediately obvious comparisons to Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids
 � this is the real deal, and it shows up the likes of pre-Eighties Xanadu
 and Roller Boogie
 poseurs with a funky, grooving panache that�s all its own.
