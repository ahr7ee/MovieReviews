      <text>Let�s make something clear: I like Nick Cannon. And when a person is basically given the keys to a Miramax production � Cannon is the star, executive producer, and story writer here � I can certainly understand the temptation to gad about onscreen: riding ATVs and Sea-Doos (no "jet skis" � these are Sea-Doo brand Sea-Doos), romancing Rush Hour 2
 hottie Sanchez, shooting endless scenes of rugby and paintball, and basically making as little of a movie as possible. Underclassman
 was probably a gas to film. Watching it, on the other hand, is like sitting in afterschool detention. Cannon plays a smart-aleck LAPD bicycle cop, a rookie on the force. You will not be surprised to learn that he�s always getting in over his head, that he�s always aggravating his captain (Marin), that he�s going to be asked at some point to hand in his badge and forget about the case, which of course he won�t do because he�s got a hunch that could blow this thing wide open, and the detectives properly assigned to the task are bumbling nimrods. An interracial-buddy element develops. A stuffy British guy might or might not be the villain. Five people � counting Cannon � collaborated on this story and the script, yet the movie seems to have been generated from a batch file. Here�s the cutline: Cannon goes undercover with rich, white party kids at a prep school to catch a killer. Cannon is charming enough to float some edgy jokes at Biff and Muffy and the West Side Kids ("Y�all beat me so bad I thought I was going to have to call Al Sharpton, get him to organize a march," he quips after the rugby game), and maybe there�s something to be said for that. Perhaps years from now graduate students will defend Cannon�s work here as a modern interpretation of trickster lore; maybe they�ll call it subversive and brilliant. Until then the movie feels a lot like Guess Who�s Coming to The OC With a Lethal Weapon 2?
 except that Adam Brody has been replaced by Johnny K. Lewis (of MTV�s Undressed
), who has a Clay Aikeny kind of thing going on. Its star, who injected such life into the surprisingly unformulaic Drumline
, is adrift in a sea of cop-movie clich�s, and Siega�s party-to-go direction hews more closely to his music-video beginnings than to his critically noted Pretty Persuasion
.
