      <text>Let�s get past the initial hurdle of accepting a movie that�s based on a line of dolls. (This is
 the season of Transformers
, isn�t it?) These dolls seem to be the epitome of everything today�s tween gal aspires toward: They�re vulgar, oversexualized clotheshorses who irritate their elders. In this live-action film, multicultural BFFs Yasmin (Ramos), Jade (Parrish), Sasha (Browning), and Cloe (Shaye) are actually rather sweet, though their �passion for fashion� is unabated. The film opens on the girls� first day of high school, as they wake to their alarm clocks in their individual bedrooms and visually link up over their computers to discuss the day�s attire. (They then fish out the items from their walk-in closets. No, I�m not jealous.) The film nicely incorporates modern-day computer artifacts into the plot, as when mean girl Meredith (Staub) carries a tiny flashdrive as a weapon. Meredith is the school�s top dog, and her goal is to divide the student population into smaller packs. And though the Bratz give voice to lofty sentiments, such as �friendship is a big deal,� a quick dissolve to junior year shows that the four friends have drifted apart, having become divided and separated by the school�s governing cliques. Their �bratitude� emerges, however, and they fight back against the cliques and their ringleader Meredith and her proud papa (Voight), who is also the principal of the school. (Voight�s shameless participation in this project could be a whole topic unto itself: the bottoming-out of Oscar winners.) At 110 minutes (including a music video over the closing credits), Bratz
 is way too long. Yet the full house of tweeners at the screening I attended would probably disagree heartily. I didn�t know I had bratitude before seeing this movie, but � there it is. For all the film�s platitudes about friendship and setting one�s inner voice free, it also supports the coolness of consumer culture and material worth. Still, there�s a filmmaking spark here that riffs on things like imagery from Moulin Rouge
 and Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western music. So, in the end, Bratz
 and I won�t be BFF, but we can coexist until the next gal-pal film comes along.
