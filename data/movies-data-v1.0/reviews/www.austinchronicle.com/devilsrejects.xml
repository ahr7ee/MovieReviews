      <text>Any film that reunites Rock 'n� Roll High School
 alumnus Riff Randall (Soles) and Principal Togar (Woronov) is aces and eights in my book, but Rob Zombie�s follow-up to his disappointing debut, House of 1,000 Corpses
, does more than just exhume a morgue full of genre favorites � it�s also the year�s most viciously entertaining psycho-road-movie-revenge-'n�-wreckage-romance. If that last hyphenate doesn�t tip you off that this warped rechristening of American Family Values isn�t for the squeamish, nothing will, so I�ll bite my tongue off and chew the fatted calves of Leslie Easterbrook, here seen channeling something akin to Gena Rowlands on mad, bad biker speed while William Forsythe gives us a remarkably accurate Warren Oates. What�s not to love? Zombie�s 2003 outing, helmed after handling directing duties on a number of White Zombie videos, was a scattershot take on Tobe Hooper�s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
 that never quite gelled into a cohesive shocker despite some winning grue and a bizarrely wacky turn by former Spider Baby
 Sid Haig as the Marx Brothers-loving killer clown Captain Spaulding. Haig and the Captain are back for this semi-sequel, which reunites the greasepainted schnorrer
 with his lunatic brood, including wife Mother Firefly (Easterbrook), daughter Baby (Moon Zombie), and son Otis P. Firefly (Moseley, "Chop Top" of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
). This time out they take it on the lam as Forsythe�s rogue Sheriff Wydell, seeking revenge for the death of his brother in House
, stalks them at every turn, operating in and out of the legal parameters with enough savagely righteous glee to render him both a worthy nemesis for this murderously perverse band of outsiders and, ultimately, a force for good twisted horrifically asunder. That Zombie�s decidedly un-P.C. film makes the Firefly clan as borderline sympathetic as it does is something of an accomplishment in and of itself and echoes The Devil�s Rejects
 most obvious antecedent, Wes Craven�s sly class-war horror show The Hills Have Eyes
. But Zombie, who gets top-notch performances from virtually his entire cast � including former Craven-iac Berryman � has as much if not more on his mind, and his film benefits immensely from not only being truly nightmarish and disturbing, but also being laugh-out-loud subversive. It�s got to be some sort of Cinema of Transgression high-water mark to find yourself chuckling away at Zombie�s wittily profane dialogue and relentless forward motion even  as the Manson-esque offspring commit motel-room atrocities that�d have Norman Bates shrieking like a little girl. The Devil�s Rejects
 fairly spurts off the screen like blood from a freshly lacerated jugular, rarely pausing for breath (except, of course, to linger lovingly over some obscene new act of random violence) until the film�s final moments, well calculated to make Sam Peckinpah grin in his grave. You can already hear the clamor of the politically correct calling for Zombie�s film to be banned, but if you watch closely, you�ll see that The Devil�s Rejects
 isn�t so much celebrating the act of violence as it is paying heartfelt homage
 to the high-grain, Seventies-era bouquet of cinematic sleaze (as well as that decade�s most loved/loathed classic rock ditties; you�ll never listen to "Free Bird" quite the same way again). And speaking of impending backlash, if the first half-decade of the new millennium has taught us anything, it�s that the human race is more abysmally mired in real-life ferocity and bloodlust than ever before, so perhaps viewing Zombie�s Super-16 death trip as both a snarky commentary on the American zeitgeist and an ode to hell-bound debauchery is right on the blood-money after all. If for some reason you feel the need to see a real
 atrocity exhibition, go turn on CNN. As the old tagline for Craven�s Last House on the Left
 so accurately put it, this is "Only a movie ... only a movie ... only a movie."
