      <text>�There should be more movies like this,� opined one grandmotherly type to another at our screening. Based on Christianna Brand�s Nurse Matilda books and featuring an A-list cast of British character actors, Nanny McPhee
 is indeed something of a rarity: a movie for children that is about children and their world. There are no aliens in it, no cartoon animals, and no fast-food restaurants. (Partly this is due to the turn-of-the-century setting, but it�s also a matter of the film�s tone.) And while the kids � seven of them � are pretty much wisenheimers, they are not cooler-than-thou, and the adults in their lives aren�t blithering idiots, but flawed people who make mistakes until they reach a point of reckoning. However, to reach the movie�s very old-fashioned message � that families must cooperate, listen to one another, and respect one another, children and adults alike � the viewer runs a gauntlet of Edwardian slapstick, and I am sad to say that there are pigs dressed as women and a mule �cutely� animated with CGI. (The children in my audience were less obviously entranced by these antics than the filmmakers might have hoped.) And per the custom of children�s entertainment, we�ve had to Kill Off the Mother, and please don�t get me started about that. I am not familiar with the Nurse Matilda books, but Nanny McPhee (Thompson) resembles Betty MacDonald�s Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle more than she does Mary Poppins: She�s darkly magical, and her discipline techniques involve extending the children�s behavior to their consequences in extremis
. Faked illness gets magically enforced bedrest and vile medicine that wriggles around on the spoon like Flubber. (In one scene, a baby is mildly endangered, causing prolonged distress to a 3-year-old next to me.) After she swoops in to the rundown manor of a widowed mortician (Firth) and starts kicking magical ass with his seven hellions, Nanny McPhee�s likewise magical warts vanish, and by film�s end Thompson looks hot, younger, and thin again; if this notion offends, parents could turn it into a teachable moment with wee viewers. The kids are all fine, and I particularly liked Thomas Sangster (Love, Actually
) as the oldest, but it�s the adults who are having a field day. Lansbury is a hoot as the detestable Aunt Adelaide (�What are we doing milling about this dreary vestibule?� she shrieks. �Sherry at once!�), and there are no words to describe the estimable Imelda Staunton as the family�s excitable cook. The film�s producers � the prolific Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan of Working Title Films � have tried family-film adaptations before (2004�s Thunderbirds
 and 1997�s The Borrowers
), but this is probably their most watchable all-ages effort to date. Parents might appreciate a lighter hand with the barnyard whimsy and food fights, but overall the movie doesn�t condescend about heavy matters (grief, healing, and blended families) and is pleasantly diverting.
