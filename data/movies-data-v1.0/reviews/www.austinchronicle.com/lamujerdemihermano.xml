      <text>Soap masquerades as high art in this south-of-the-border romantic drama, which has nevertheless proved a huge hit during its Mexican and Latin American release. Essentially a gussied-up telenovela
, this film about a love triangle is predictable and thin, even though the actors are polished and cinematographer Andres Sanchez provides the film with a handsome look. Popular Peruvian novelist Jaime Bayly adapted his own work for the film�s screenplay but moved the story�s setting to Mexico City. Fellow Peruvian de Montreuil directs with a sure hand, although he�s unable to turn any of the three central characters into likable personalities. The likelihood of U.S. crossover success for La Mujer de Mi Hermano
 will rest primarily with Spanish-speaking audiences here that spark to its familiar melodramatic patterns and late-in-the-movie introduction of plot developments that involve abortion and homosexuality. After 10 years of marriage, Zoe (telenovela star Mori) has grown bored with her husband, Ignacio (Meier), and their glass-walled designer house. The marriage is relatively passionless (we learn that Ignacio will only make love to her on Saturdays), and though they wish to have a child it�s revealed that Ignacio is sterile. Ignacio�s brother Gonzalo (Cardona) is a painter, a womanizer, and something of a starving artiste, who lives off the money Ignacio gives him while thumbing his nose at the bourgeoisie. Soon Gonzalo and Zoe are sharing hot, illicit love. Despite the film�s title, which translates into English as My Brother�s Wife
, the story is not told from Gonzalo�s perspective. Zoe�s choices are starkly opposite: Stay with her disinterested and compulsively orderly husband, or flee to the arms of his paint-spattered, prodigal brother. The story�s third-act complications are a bit more involving, yet the characters never come across as anything more than self-interested parties. It�s hard to have a rooting interest in any of their fates, and even less in the outcome of this movie.
