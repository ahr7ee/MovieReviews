      <text>This isn�t Nicole Kidman�s first dalliance with witchcraft, and it is one of Bewitched
�s unfortunate achievements that it actually makes one pine for Kidman�s 1998 dud, Practical Magic
. That witch at least had some sass; this cardigan-clad witch, alas, is an altogether more benign being, and by "benign" I mean boring. The so-very-meta premise goes as such: A closeted witch named Isabel (Kidman) is cast in a TV remake of the classic Sixties show starring Elizabeth Montgomery. Playing her TV husband, Darren, is Jack Wyatt (Ferrell), a washed-up movie star trying to make a comeback. Isabel, meanwhile, is trying to go straight (and the movie gets some laughs out of Isabel�s frequent falls off the no-witchcraft wagon); she takes the acting gig primarily because she likes the look of Jack and likes the idea of falling in love the old-fashioned way. The repurposing of classic television shows for feature film fodder is by now a rather stale business � a fact the script (by Ephron, her sister, Delia, and frequent Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay) references in a tongue-in-cheek joke. In fact, it�s rather on the nose: Bewitched
 feigns like it�s doing something inventive but it�s really rather reductive, in both its only-when-convenient nostalgia for the original show and its borrowing of elements from other Ephron pictures (You�ve Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle)
. Wisecracking secondary characters are usually the filmmaker�s strong suit, but she overcompensates here with an excess of mostly unmemorable bit players. (Caine, as Isabel�s warlock father, is the one bright spot.) The lead characters are just as thinly sketched, as is their attraction. God only knows why Isabel settles on Jack, a preening prat; just as unlikely is everyone�s astonishment at Jack�s movie-star megalomania (the film is set in Hollywood � antics like Jack�s are a dime a dozen in that town). Ferrell, in need of a shorter leash, never makes the character any more than a caricature, and Kidman, in a rare comedic role, suffers, too. Her Isabel is, I suppose, an innocent, but that mistranslates into dimness (she doesn�t know what a "dick" is, which makes one wonder if chastity pledges are issued to witches along with their broomsticks). There�s a certain floofiness
 to Isabel, a trait common to Ephron�s woman-child characters. It�s a sort of a sexless ditziness that is meant to be endearing (and in Ephron�s most frequent leading lady, Meg Ryan, often is). But Kidman is too sharp an actress for so much cuddliness. If this misfire doesn�t convince her to hang up the pointy hat, then might I suggest a remake of Bell, Book, and Candle
? Kim Novak�s cool seductress is exactly
 the kind of witchy woman Kidman was born to play.
