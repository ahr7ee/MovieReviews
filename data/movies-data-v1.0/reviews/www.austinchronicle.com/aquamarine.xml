      <text>Omigod, you guys! I just saw, like, the cutest movie! It�s based on a YA novel by Alice Hoffman, and it�s about these two total best friends who meet up with � a mermaid! They take her shopping, and they all get streaks in their hair, and they totally help her fall in love with this lifeguard who is really
 fine and never wears a shirt, okay? But you know what? Like, if you read a review of this movie in the newspaper, that person would, like, totally hate it. Because critics aren�t supposed to like movies with shopping mermaids and stuff. If there�s a makeover scene, they walk out, right? Even though this mermaid (Paxton) is really nice, and she�s like a cool big sister, only she has a tail in the water, but she can totally take a sweatshirt and turn it into a halter minidress, and she even takes Claire (Roberts, niece of Julia if that matters) and Hailey (Levesque) to the weirdest place � a vintage store. And while I don�t want to give the ending away, it turns out that the whole movie isn�t even about getting a cute boy to notice you; it�s about friendships between young women and how that�s more important than anything. You know those magazines, like Cosmo Girl
, that are all about how you�re supposed to be coy but not aloof and available but not scary, and it makes being a girl into some impossible paradox of weird stuff that nobody can actually do? The movie totally
 makes fun of that. Oh, and this mermaid can summon dolphins. I know! If my mom saw this movie, she would think it was so goofy. But for what it is, I think it�s pretty okay. It�s not going to win an Oscar or anything. But I liked how it was actually made for tween girls. We never get any movies, and we�re totally growing up too fast anyway. Nobody over the age of 13 would like this movie, but so what? Is being a girl a bad thing? Like, everybody knows what it feels like to have your best friend move away and to feel really, really sad because your parents drowned in a boating accident and you have to live with your grandparents on their beach resort and you don�t have any friends because you live in Florida and everybody is so beautiful and rich and stupid like that mean girl Cecilia (Kebbel), whose dad is the weatherman. I mean, who said that�s any dumber than any of the kazillion movies made for teenage boys? You really have to ask yourself, �Okay, is this better or worse than that The Dukes of Hazzard
 movie?� Because at least this movie has a message for girls besides, like, �If you want something from boys, wear a bikini under a raincoat and act really stupid.� Can you believe Jessica Simpson was almost in this movie? Like, she doesn�t even know what tuna is. I�m so sure she could play a fish.
