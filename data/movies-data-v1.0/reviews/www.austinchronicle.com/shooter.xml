      <text>To an extent I�m willing to indulge a dunderheaded commando actioner such as Shooter
 if one of its villains is an omnipotent Cheney-esque senator; in these times we all need catharsis. Less subversive and infinitely less intelligent than 1999�s Wahlberg-starrer Three Kings
, this movie does blow lots of shit up real good
 and punishes contemptible public figures otherwise left unaccountable for massacring African villagers. And would you believe they�re in it � for the oil? So the movie has that going for it. Otherwise? Retired and improbably named ex-Marine Corps sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) falls for the oldest trick in the book � the book being Stephen Hunter�s Point of Impact
, here adapted leadenly to the screen by Red Planet
�s Jonathan Lemkin � and helps a shady G-man (Glover, who�s been instructed to speak as if he�s got strep) �prevent� the assassination of the president. But before you can say �fall guy,� Swagger is wanted for murder and on the run, and though they may have trained him to kill, they want him dead, and all that. There�s a junior agent (Pe�a) who believes Swagger has been framed and Barbie-doll co-stars (Mara and Mitra) who change clothes often and discharge weapons while wearing lots of eyeliner. It�s nice to see Serbedzija rolling around in a Strangelove
 wheelchair, snarling, �Nothing, no matter how horrible, happens without the permission of the government.� But if that�s true, Shooter
 is one more reason to impeach.
