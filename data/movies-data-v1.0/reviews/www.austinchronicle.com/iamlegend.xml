      <text>In a bit of black irony any cynic would have to appreciate, the virus that decimates the world�s population in I Am Legend
 is the result of an unforeseen reaction to a miraculous new cancer vaccine. One minute that vaccine�s developer, Dr. Krippen (a brilliant, uncredited Emma Thompson), is informing the public that they can now feel free to smoke filterless cigarettes and lie out in the sun; the next, Manhattan is an overgrown wasteland where thousands of rusting, driverless cars fill the streets, and herds of lions roam through Central Park like it�s the African savanna. The Krippen Virus has killed 5.5 billion people, leaving the few unlucky souls who have an immunity alone with 500 million mutated, gray-skinned, rabid cannibals who come out at night to feast on the blood of the living and screech at great volumes. In this latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's apocalyptic science-fiction novel of 1954 (which has been previously adapted at least a couple of times as The Last Man on Earth
 with Vincent Price and The Omega Man
 starring Charlton Heston), Smith plays Robert Neville, a military immunologist who is the only real human left in New York. By day he wanders the city�s empty avenues with his German shepherd, Sam, scavenging for food and gasoline and borrowing every title at his local movie-rental house in alphabetical order; by night he barricades himself in his apartment with his rifle to watch DVDs and wait for the living dead to break down the door. All this happens during the film�s first 10 minutes, so initially I was optimistic. First of all, Lawrence�s desolate Manhattan is a wonder to behold. Devoid of human activity, the city, with its giant decaying billboards and skyscrapers, looks like the desperate cry of a species lashing out at inevitable extinction. And secondly, Smith�s Neville (who appears onscreen alone, or with his dog, throughout most of the movie) is a hero with real psychological potential. No unblinking model of action-film courage, he is terrified, lonely, and racked with guilt over his inability to save the lives of � well, anyone � a guilt he tries to assuage by working on a vaccine for the vaccine that will save humanity, not to mention his own soul. Unfortunately, after those first 10 minutes, it�s all downhill for I Am Legend
, as the film descends into a monster-movie malaise starring a horde of balding CGI monsters that look like refugees from a video game and that will scare absolutely no one, save those who worry that green-screening is ruining the movies. By the time another survivor, named Anna (Braga), shows up in the film�s third act with news of a possible safe colony in Vermont, I was so numb to the threat of cartoonish zombie horror that I found myself wondering how she had managed to get into Manhattan if all its bridges had been destroyed years before as part of a military quarantine. Did the National Guard forget to seal up the Holland Tunnel? And if so, did Anna still have to pay the toll?
