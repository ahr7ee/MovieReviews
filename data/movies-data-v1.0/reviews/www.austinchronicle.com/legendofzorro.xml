      <text>Here�s a neat party trick I came up with the other evening: Take The Legend of Zorro
 leads Banderas, Zeta-Jones, and Alonso and replace them with Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Freddie Boath; insert the name "Im-Ho-Tep" whenever anyone in The Legend of Zorro
 adds extraneous syllables to the word "California"; and then confuse ancient Egyptian legends with the writings of Johnston McCulley. Presto chango: Zorro�s secret identity is revealed, and it ain�t Douglas Fairbanks. (Note: This can also be performed with chilled maraschino cherries and Guy Williams, but the results are far less zesty.) What started out as a promising return to form for that mythic Mexican buckler of swash has, in a single sequel, devolved into The Mummy Returns
-lite, or, if you prefer, Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Box Office
. Adding a tyke to the mix, in this case Alonso�s Joaquin de la Vega � pint-sized scion of pop Alejandro, aka Zorro � is as old a Hollywood standby as the hairs on Freddie Bartholomew�s cadaver�s chin and twice as ticklish. While it may add a key demographic to the moviegoing mix, it also just as often alienates those fans who found the original material just fine sans Fauntleroy-isms, as is the case with this puling, strained-beets-and-formula sequel to 1998�s top-notch The Mask of Zorro
. Whereas the Zorro of yore was a cunning subversive with libidinous guerrilla panache literally leaking from his very pores � Ch� with a bullwhip � this new take is something akin to a Bizarro World, Hugh Beaumont version: Leave It to Zorro
, indeed. The interchangeability of plotlines between the aforementioned franchises is no mistake, either. Like the childhood add-ons, the narrative elements are more or less the same, e.g., parents get in trouble while acting like kids, and kids fly into action to save the day, which makes for a pretty freaky Friday any day of the week, and offers guaranteed relief to harried moms and dads utilizing the matinee as a weekend babysitter. The Legend of Zorro
 so erodes the original character it�s as though we�re receiving a glimpse of Don Diego�s hidden nightmares: lusty adventures replaced with jealous conniption fits and quality time with the li�l scamp. It doesn�t take too much effort to push the whole sagging mess into Freudian territory, but somehow I doubt that�s what director Campbell had in mind. (Then again, his directorial debut was something called The Sex Thief
, so who�s to say?) There are precious few things for a Zorro fan � or a film fan, for that matter � not to loathe about The Legend of Zorro
, not least of which is the movie�s central conceit of a shadowy New World Order hellbent on denying statehood to California, and led by Sewell no less. It�s a page torn from The Wild Wild West
�s playbook, while Zorro�s sitcomic divorce from long-suffering wife Elena and his consequent ornery bachelorhood is straight out of the Bill Bixby Guide to Modern Romance
. "People let me tell ya �bout my best friend." Thanks, no, I�m busy sharpening my rapier.
