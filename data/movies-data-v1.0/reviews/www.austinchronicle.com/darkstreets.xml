      <text>Let no one ever say that Dark Streets
 doesn�t have the perfect title. It may not be much more than a stylized regurgitation of creaky film-noir clich�s and crime-fiction conventions � but its streets are undeniably dark. As are its bedrooms, boardrooms, hallways, and power plants. In fact, the whole movie looks like it was shot through a piece of cheesecloth, as if the search for the right visual complement to this tale of urban decay, melancholy, and murder caused director Samuels to overshoot symbolic murkiness and crash-land in a world of near-comic indecipherability. Watching it, I felt like Claudius at the opening-night performance of The Mousetrap
 � Give me some light!
 � and entertained a similar notion of stomping out of the theatre. But no one ever said being a film critic would be a bowl of chocolate ice cream, so I toughed it out (with help from the film�s soundtrack, a collection of blues originals performed by legends like Etta James, Aaron Neville, and B.B. King, all of whom know a little something about spinning darkness into art) and managed, with considerable squinting, to tie together the various strands of the movie�s muddled storyline. Mann plays Chaz Davenport, the despondent son of a rich but recently deceased father living in a crime-ridden Depression-era city where gangsters have hijacked the municipal power supply. He�s in debt to loan sharks all over town, but the nightclub he owns doesn�t make any money. So, facing the prospect of an unpleasant death, Chaz does what any red-blooded man living on borrowed time would do: He drinks to excess and sleeps with as many of the club�s dancers as he can. This includes mysterious new girl Madelaine (Miko), a femme fatale with doe eyes, a seductive singing voice, and a creepy father (Koteas) who looks like Erich von Stroheim in The Grand Illusion
 � if von Stroheim�s character in Grand Illusion
 were the synthesizer player in a goth band. It�s not clear what Madelaine and her dad are up to, whether they�re looking to protect Chaz or ruin him, or if Chaz realizes just how much trouble he�s in, but what is
 clear is that Samuels and screenwriter Wallace King are huge Mickey Spillane fans. They happily chart their hero�s descent into the criminal underworld with that familiar brand of naked-city, private-detective, raincoats-and-fedoras, tough-guys-and-dangerous-dames, pop-existential street poetry Spillane raised to an art form but that has long since become a formula and a gag. Dark Streets
 may be rich in mood, but it�s less an original movie than a copy of a copy of a copy of something Hollywood once dabbled in and then forgot about, a collection of 1950s B-movie mannerisms that would have made for a great parody if only it were capable of laughing at its own hard-boiled absurdity.
