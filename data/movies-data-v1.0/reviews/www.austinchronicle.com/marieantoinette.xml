      <text>�Dear God, guide us and protect us,� whispers Louis XVI (Schwartzman) upon his coronation, after his father�s death from smallpox. �We are too young to reign.� Thus does writer/director Coppola render the story of his bride, the famous Marie-Antoinette (Dunst), and her court as a sort of 18th-century teenage riot, replete with a shopping montage set to Bow Wow Wow. There�s nothing terribly problematic about Coppola�s anachronistic New Wave needle-dropping, which halts before the Bastille falls and the tumbrels start rolling, but for a simple excess of it. Still, is there a more perfect soundtrack to a forbidden romp between a teenage princess and Count Axel von Fersen (Dior model Jamie Dornan) than �Kings of the Wild Frontier� by Adam &amp; the Ants? Based upon British historian Antonia Fraser�s 2001 biography, Coppola�s script follows the 14-year-old dauphine to Versailles, where she is entirely divested of her Austrian heritage and subjected to humiliating domestic rituals before her court. (�This is ridiculous,� she scoffs to the Comtesse de Noailles � the excellently forbidding Davis � who replies matter-of-factly, �This is Versailles.�) Unable to arouse the ardor of her shy, puffy new husband � he prefers hunting and possibly men, it is rumored, and Coppola makes gentle sport of his strenuous eating habits � she sates herself on the pleasures the palace otherwise provides: finery, champagne, masked balls (cue Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees), gambling, opium, gossip, pastries, opera, and her bucolic chateau. Her indulgences are entirely apolitical, born of youthful hedonism and the frustrated drive to maintain her royal foothold � and a tenuous alliance between Austria and France � in the absence of an heir. Finally, as motherhood transforms Marie-Antoinette into a more sympathetic figure, Dunst transforms, as well � from a callow pleasure-hound whose translucent beauty belies a well-aimed smirk to a grave and haunted woman, dead-eyed, wandering the halls of a empty palace while a mob gathers outside, calling for her head. It�s a fine performance, a true star turn. Don�t fear the film�s early reviews from Cannes, which too often slighted Marie Antoinette
 for being fluffy (it isn�t, though its heroine is) or ahistorical (it isn�t, though it is contemporary). In casting an all-American Jersey girl and surrounding her with Manolo Blahniks and the Strokes, Coppola draws a connection between her audience (domestically, at least) and the doomed dauphine, who is likewise insulated and distracted from her country�s pointless involvement in a disastrous foreign war that is bankrupting its government and starving its people � and all the while she spends, spends, spends.
