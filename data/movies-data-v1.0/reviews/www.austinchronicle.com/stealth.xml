      <text>The boys and girls of summer get a Mach-5 work-over in the newest big bang theory from Rob Cohen (XXX
, The Fast and the Furious
), which semicompetently welds 2001
�s amoral HAL 9000 computer to the Top Gun
 school of flight- and filmcraft, making for a supremely silly but ultimately fun popcorn shoot-�em-up. The twitchy tweener next to me offered running commentary along the lines of "awesome!!!" and "kickass!!!", but Cohen�s film, despite its video-game, user-friendly toggles � clearly marked "Adrenaline" and "More Adrenaline" � plays like a slapdash assemblage of the greatest hits of conspiracy-minded action cinema. Apart from the pointedly obvious Kubrick and Tony Scott references, Stealth
 also mines everything from John Badham�s 1983 renegade chopper opus Blue Thunder
 to, uh, John Badham�s 1983 renegade computer opus WarGames
, and, just for laffs, John Badham�s 1986 war-bot comedy Short Circuit
. Sadly, the humor here is apparently unintentional and Ally Sheedy is nowhere to be found, but tonal quibbles such as these pale when confronted by the sheer Richter-trembling magnitude of Cohen�s bravura use of CGI and a 100-ton gimbal (used to spin and gyrate the actors inside the prop-cockpits), courtesy of Digital Domain and special effects supervisor John Frazier, respectively. The script, from sometime genre favorite W.D. Richter (Big Trouble in Little China
), is a hamfisted collection of cornball military clich�s that frequently cross over into Absurdistan airspace before vectoring back toward the friendly skies of sci-fi, but even that fails to put much of a dent in the mental-whiplash-inducing forward motion of this two-hours-plus film. (To Cohen�s credit, it feels like a swift 90.) The plot? Elite U.S. Navy fliers and Best Friends 4-Ever Gannon (Lucas), Wade (Biel), and Purcell (Foxx) are assigned a new wingman by their thorny overseer Capt. Cummings (Shepard, doing Chuck Yeager gone sour). The new wingman is not a human being but instead an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle acronymed EDI (for Extreme Deep Invader), which was created by the Navy and Richard Roxburgh�s Dr. Keith Orbit in the hopes of someday replacing flyboys (and -girls) altogether. Team leader Gannon has his doubts and says as much after the robotic EDI disobeys a direct order and turns a nuke-empowered terrorist cell into pink mist in the mountains of the former Soviet Union, but like Plan 9 From Outer Space
�s crusading pilot Jeff Trent, he�s "muzzled by Army brass." Well, Navy brass, really, but either way a conspiracy is afoot and when EDI is struck by lightning after a particularly treacherous mission, the UCAV begins to think for itself and decides, not unwisely for the benefit of the audience, that it�s fun to blow things up. What follows is a circuitous route to redemption for almost all involved, replete with WW III-inducing skirmishes with the Russian Federation air force and despot-du-jour Kim Jong Il. It�s Hollywood hokum in extremis, and while the Gannon/Wade romantic-competition subplot threatens to ground the film every quarter-hour or so, Cohen�s mastery of the big-budget aerial action sequences repeatedly acts as a epinephrine jab to the heart of what might have otherwise been a high flying DOA.
