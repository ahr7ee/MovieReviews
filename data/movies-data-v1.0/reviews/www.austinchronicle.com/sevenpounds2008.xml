      <text>Back when Will Smith was first making the unprecedented leap from novelty rapper to World�s Biggest Movie Star, he tended to rely more on his charm than his acting ability to win over audiences. Looking to be his generation�s answer to Harrison Ford, he romped his way through action movies with an air of unquestioned confidence, knowing his undeniable screen presence, deftness with a one-liner, and million-kilowatt smile would be enough to rally filmgoers to his side � in the process forgoing the subtler tones that were at his command, as demonstrated by earlier, more nuanced, performances in small dramas such as Six Degrees of Separation
. In the last few years, however, Smith the actor has begun to reassert himself, pushing Smith the dazzling, larger-than-life, box-office phenomenon into the shadows. First came Ali
, then The Pursuit of Happyness
, movies that were conspicuously lacking in that peculiar blend of goofball sincerity, self-mocking street toughness, and Dennis the Menace deviance that defined the Fresh Prince persona. Even his action roles started turning noticeably dour: I Am Legend
 and Hancock
 may have been marketed as bubbly comic-book trifles, but they were really about existential collapse, more concerned with survival than heroism. No longer was Smith the guy in the room everybody loved; now he was the only
 guy in the room, with all his imperfections on display � a character straight out of Camus, if Camus had ever bothered to write about flesh-eating zombies. Now, with Seven Pounds
, the transformation of Will Smith is complete: Gone is any trace of love-me impishness, replaced by one of the sourest pusses Hollywood has seen since Joaquin Phoenix got his Screen Actors Guild card. Smith plays Ben Thomas, a once-successful engineer who was involved in an auto accident years before and who now leads a desperate life of self-loathing and regret. Seeking out the most effective and productive means of self-flagellation, he devises an elaborate scheme of charity/contrition designed to save strangers� lives through the abandonment of his own. I�m reluctant to say too much about the plot of Seven Pounds
, as director Muccino (reuniting with his Happyness
 star) and writer Grant Nieporte have gone through pains to keep viewers in a state of suspended half-confusion, but it is safe to reveal that Ben�s work involves helping damaged souls barely hanging on to society�s bottom rung, in particular a beautiful young woman (Dawson) who has a congenital heart defect but enough heart to nudge Ben toward something resembling absolution. Throughout the film, Smith proves himself adept in the art of conflicted melancholy � always speaking at the wrong volume, rarely looking people in the eye, all 1,000-yard stares and forced smiles � and Muccino responds to his star�s seriousness with enough darkness and moral ambivalence to keep his story from toppling into heartwarming, pay-it-forward mawkishness. Together they�ve proved the once-unimaginable theory that Smith is more likable the less he tries to make us like him.
