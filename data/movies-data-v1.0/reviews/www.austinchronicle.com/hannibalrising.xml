      <text>Writer Thomas Harris, creator of legendary Hollywood sociopath Dr. Hannibal �the Cannibal� Lecter, has been asked countless times over the last 25 years how it was his hero came to be a monster. Apparently readers and viewers aren�t satisfied with the hours of gruesome fun Hannibal has provided them; they want to get the good doctor on a leather couch and peel back a few layers: �Tell me about your mother, Dr. Lecter.� Well, as the man said, when the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers, and now Harris has given us our answer: Hannibal Rising
, an uninspired and altogether unnecessary biography of a madman. When we first meet him, Hannibal is just an average boy of 7 or 8, passing a happy hour with his beloved little sister, Mischa (Tachovska), outside their family�s castle in Lithuania during the winter of 1944. Times being what they are, however, and Lithuania being where it is, the Lecter family estate is quickly becoming a battleground for Hitler�s and Stalin�s armies, so that hour is cut short by air strikes and tank assaults. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, Hannibal and Mischa�s parents are killed, and the two children are taken hostage by a band of sinister, growling Lithuanian bandits. Long story short: The winter grows long, the food runs short, the bandits get hungry, Mischa starts to look more and more like a giant turkey leg, and, in the end, poor Hannibal is left without a sister, replaced by a deep well of boiling hostility. Upon escaping to France eight years later � troubled all the while by nightmares and an unnatural affinity for sharp metal objects � he begins the long, hard slog toward revenge. Revenge? That�s the answer? How unimaginative, how unsatisfying, how entirely unlike our Hannibal. Surely the roots of that madman�s bloody, fleshy desires run deeper than mere neuroses and childhood trauma, down into the realm of severe asocial neurological dysfunction. That�s the Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins presented so deliciously in The Silence of the Lambs
, and his near-operatic pathology was the reason we kept watching through two sequels. Unfortunately, Hopkins is nowhere to be found in Hannibal Rising
. Instead we get Ulliel, an elegantly chiseled cipher with minimal acting talent and a laughable accent that would make a late-night TV creep-show host blush (�Good eeeeeeveniiing,� he oozes, like a B-movie Dracula). All the seductiveness is gone from Hannibal, as is the riddle behind his motivation, and what remains is the whining of an adolescent with a taste for human flesh. By erasing all the mystery from Lecter�s past, Harris and director Webber have also stripped him of his ability to terrify (who�s going to lose sleep if he noshes on a few Nazis?), and their film, though gory and violent enough, is almost entirely devoid of shock or suspense. Who would have thought mass murder and cannibalism could be so dull?
