      <text>Canny casting and a sly anti-consumerist message give this splashy big-screen treatment of the eponymous comic strip (by Austinite Michael Fry and former Texan T. Lewis) extra appeal for grownups, but like a lot of animated fare, it�s overly busy, lacking the comic�s gentle, contemplative air. I�m also sad to report that what the MPAA calls �mild comic action� is a sort of Acme-Laboratories slapstick violence, and there�s a scaryass bear (voiced by Nolte) who may terrify small-fries by growling, �And don�t even think about running away because I will hunt you down and kill you.� Yet DreamWorks� entry in the cartoon-blockbuster sweepstakes (alongside Fox�s Ice Age: The Meltdown
 and Pixar�s upcoming Cars
) has its pleasures � if you can roll with ursine death threats and an exterminator (Church) jonesing for critter blood. Rakish raccoon R.J. (Willis) wanders into the master-planned bubble of El Rancho Camelot � �Your gateway to the good life� � in search of junk food, but he finds something more: a surrogate family of gentle wilderness creatures shepherded by Verne (Shandling), a cautious and put-upon turtle. (�I�m naturally tentative. There�s even places in my shell I�ve never been,� Shandling moans.) Verne and the gang � squirrel Hammy (Carell), skunk Stella (Sykes), possums Ozzie and Heather (Shatner and Lavigne, sadly less compelling as a father-daughter combination than you might expect), and a family of sweetly Midwestern porcupines (Levy and O�Hara) � awaken from their hibernal slumber to find their woods entirely surrounded by a massive hedge, beyond which lie acres of McMansions guarded by a hysterical homeowners� president (Janney). Everyone needs to eat, so the animals broach the hedge and discover chips, Dr. Phil, and SUVs. (�Humans ride around in it because they�re slowly losing their ability to walk,� R.J. explains.) The film retains most of the strip�s charm when it slows down to a cute, fuzzy satire of human foibles, and the animation technology allows a wonderful funhouse view of suburban living in the expository scenes. The cast is uniformly good, but Carell steals it as Hammy, the strip�s lovable dingbat. Carell has a knack for investing cartoonish characterizations with undeniable heart, and Hammy�s addle-brained innocence is a perfect fit. Unfortunately, the script (by no fewer than four writers) is more dialogue than story, and it confuses mayhem with action, like too many family entertainments (Chicken Little
, I�m looking in your direction). Three songs by Ben Folds (including a reworked version of �Rockin� the Suburbs�) neither add to nor detract from the project, which could be the faintest praise ever. With more attention to the fundamentals of narrative, Over the Hedge
 wouldn�t be so over the top. (See
