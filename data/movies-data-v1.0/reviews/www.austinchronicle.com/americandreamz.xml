      <text>Weitz Brothers, Weitz Brothers, Weitz Brothers. Paul and Chris, you did your thing, dawgs. You made it to Hollywood (Chuck &amp; Buck
), you made your money (American Pie
), made some art (About a Boy
), and then you got back into the indie thing (you produced Bickford Schmeckler�s Cool Ideas
. which screened at SXSW, and I totally pimped that). That�s a real interesting progression, but then you cut the brotherly cord, leaving Paul to make In Good Company
 and American Dreamz
 on his own. And tonight I just wasn�t feeling it. I think you�re both still in it to win this thing, and I wanna see what you do in the future, but American Dreamz
 is kind of all over the place from the beginning. You have a guy like Simon Cowell (Grant), and he�s really good at doing that one particular thing. You�re telling us television executives are heartless and manipulative, and that�s kind of edgy, but it�s also kind of just, like, �Hey, Hugh Grant is being like Simon.� And I think we all agree at this stage in American culture that television executives are heartless and manipulative, so you�re going to have to really nail
 it, man. We�ve heard it before. We know what to expect when the best karaoke singer in Padookie, Ohio (Moore) gets her heart set on becoming a TV pop star. That whole part of the movie was not that tight, and you took way too long in getting to the contest. But hold up, I�m not done. You started pulling it together when you stepped up the part where Dennis Quaid plays the president of the United States � the current one. He�s called Staton, but it�s G.W., and Marcia Gay Harden is tight as Laura. When you needed somebody to satirize Texans, you called in Texans, and I appreciate that. Without the ear transmitter broadcasting from his chief advisor (Dafoe in his most terrifying role ever), the president can�t keep that constipated smirk off his face. That�s what your movie is really about, dawg. It�s not about the vapidity of popular culture; it�s about the country-fried jackass at the helm of our nation. You were thisclose. But you�re driving around with Hugh Grant and Mandy Moore in a Ferrari too much. Your satire could have been a lot more balls-out. You�re telling me straight out George W. Bush is a likable chump who would be sensible enough to be horrified if he actually read a newspaper, and you�re giving me one of the cinema�s most seething villains as Karl Rove. That�s a pretty big thing to say, and you could have really brought your game. But you did the crossover thing. You�re working on youth appeal as the creators of American Pie
. We all know Idol
 sucks. Maybe America will prove me wrong by voting, but I felt like you were holding back until the end. And I think if the kids like you, that�ll be okay. You�re showing them something more than Jessica Alba�s humps. Your song choices (by Stephen Trask) were good. Your cast was good. It was pretty okay, but you�ve set the bar higher on this competition.
