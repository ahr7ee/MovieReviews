      <text>"I thought it would be funnier," murmured another filmgoer at the close of this celluloid update of Jackie Gleason�s 1950s blue-collar comedy chestnut. And that, I can only assume, is one bravely optimistic man. Four screenwriters, including veteran TV producer Danny Jacobson, have cobbled together a script so rickety that it could itself pass as one of Ralph Kramden�s harebrained get-rich schemes. Schultz�s direction is plodding, with the artistic flair of spackle, and he seems to have instructed his cast to mimic their small-screen forebears down to the last gesture; more�s the pity, because a more radical reworking of the show�s subject matter (the myth of class mobility and the strain upon marriages whose partners sling the hash and fix the sewers of America�s largest and most contentious city) would be worth seeing, particularly with the film�s predominantly African-American cast. Instead, the film engages the issue of racism only once, in its only good joke: fashionably high-strung, glad-handing white partygoers are unable to distinguish two Asian musicians from Ralph (Cedric the Entertainer) and his doofy neighbor Ed (Epps). Sure, there�s a reptilian property developer (Stoltz, who doesn�t have to do much besides show up) threatening to snatch away the Kramdens� only chance at homeownership, but the movie cares more about its "make money" montages, mother-in-law jokes, and the doleful eyes of a spotted greyhound (animal actor Iggy) rescued from a Dumpster. Leguizamo, of course, is the movie�s wild card; as the dubiously credentialed trainer recruited to prep Iggy for the inevitable Big Race, he�s so bizarre that he threatens to make the movie interesting. Otherwise the movie bumbles along in a sort of gimmicky torpor, as if assured that the pedigree of its cast and its strategic marketing campaign can fill enough urban seats for a decent opening weekend. It�s a shame when a movie brings together so many underutilized thespians of color � even Ajay Naidu of Office Space
 is in here someplace � and gives them absolutely nothing to do.
