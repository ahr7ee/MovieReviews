      <text>�Are you, like, a crazy person?� asks Evey Hammond (Portman), moments after being rescued from the post-curfew clutches of a pair of government enforcer/thugs by the swashbuckling, masked enigma known only as �V� (Weaving). As it turns out, he is � the Guy Fawkes mask cloaking his face, with its postcoital Mona Lisa
 grin and echoes of powder-kegs past is a dead giveaway. He�s also the last virulent gasp and raised fist of rebellion amidst a cowed and broken British citizenry in the year 2020, a place we quickly discover is at once heavily, obviously redolent of the fascistic stink of George Orwell�s 1984
, and, in the film�s most unnerving moments, a place with eerie parallels to the one in which the world � the real world � currently finds itself. �America,� we are told, is now �the world�s largest leper colony,� brought to its knees by terrorism, plague, and all manner of not-unimaginable crises. England, however, has endured, thanks to a contrived rise in jackboots and truncheons and the rebirth of outright fascism in the wake of its own horrific terror attacks. (It�s interesting if not entirely relevant to note that in a grim moment of art and reality going head-to-head, V for Vendetta
�s initial release date of November 5, 2005 was pushed back to its current slot in the wake of the London bombings of last July.) V himself is a terrorist (or, if you prefer, a freedom fighter), and he proves it by blowing up a major British landmark moments after saving Evey�s life. He then commandeers the airwaves and invites the shellshocked citizenry to stand beside him in exactly one year when he will blow up the Parliament and thereby, hopefully, shatter tyranny�s stranglehold on his country. All of this is a prelude to one of the most eloquent tales in ages of dysfunctional love � between a man and his ideals; between a country and its government; and, in the end, between Evey and V. Scripted by the Wachowski brothers (the Matrix
 trilogy) and adapted from the graphic novel by Alan Moore (Watchmen
, who, in a fit of pique too complicated to go into here, has since had his name removed from the film), V for Vendetta
 is first and foremost a futuristic slice of pop-culture agitprop, replete with a costumed antihero, lovingly choreographed action sequences, and a terrific, rousing score by Dario Marianelli. It�s also rife with cunningly ornate dialogue � the hyper-literate V is as skilled with his tongue as he is with his more prosaic ordnance � and most enchantingly, a surplus of smarts. This is a thinking person�s action film and all the more entertaining for it. Heroic sloganeering abounds: �People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people� and �A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having,� the latter nicked from feminist Emma Goldman, are two of the more memorable (and accurate) ones. It�s also a slam-bang piece of popcorn entertainment. Like its titular revolutionary, it is not, however, without its faults, chief among them a muddy narrative through-line and Hurt�s gnashing, overkill performance as the Big Brother-esque Chancellor Sutler. That�s balanced by one of the most exquisitely nuanced performances Portman has ever offered � she�s as radiant and revolutionary as the Statue of Liberty and her innate humanity carries the film across its weaker and more pedantic potholes. Whether V for Vendetta
, the tale of a girl and her terrorist and the homeland they both love and revile in equal measure, withstands the test of time and becomes a pop-culture cinematic touchstone remains to be seen. What it has for certain, and what it has in spades, are some very real ideas. And, to paraphrase this V fellow, ideas are box-office-proof.
