      <text>Granted, college basketball�s regular season is in full swing now, but Glory Road
 might have been better served by a March release date, when hoops fans are especially hungry for Cinderella stories and Disney-sanitized homilies. Cut from the same cloth as Remember the Titans
 and boasting the same producer (Jerry Bruckheimer), distributor (Touchstone), and a co-writer (Gregory Allen Howard), the frequently rousing Glory Road
 presents a fictionalized account of what many count as the most significant NCAA basketball game ever played, between Don Haskins� underdog Texas Western (now UTEP) and Adolph Rupp�s perennial powerhouse Kentucky in the 1966 championship title game. The significance � beyond being a corker of a game � came down to Haskins� then-revolutionary call to start five black players on the paint.  After a zippy opening montage of historical footage that sets up the racial tensions of the time (and kicks off the film�s terrific, era-specific soundtrack), Glory Road
 hits the road as new coach Haskins (Lucas) scours the country for recruits. White players won�t come to the unranked, cash-poor Texas Western, and so Haskins turns to black players, most of whom are relegated to schoolyard courts or benchwarming in favor of white ballers. Glory Road
 releases the �thumping motivational speech� floodgates early, when Haskins convinces superstar guard Bobby Joe Hill (Luke) to join up, and it�s but the first of many speeches to come. You can�t argue with the message of the movie, but you can take issue with its formulaic approach. The players, portrayed by a host of charismatic, mostly unknown actors, are largely reduced to quirks (the ladies� man, the Black Power guy, etc.); a one-note Lucas, who reportedly gained 35 pounds for the part, stalks through every scene, belly-first and bellowing all the way; and the script hangs on such ready-made metaphors as the newly diagnosed teammate whose heart is literally too large. (Insert Lucas growling, but growling motivationally
: �We�re gonna need you. We�re gonna need your courage.�) And for those of us who thrill every year come March Madness, the Big Dance here will be an awful disappointment: Texas Western�s tournament trajectory is reduced to two games � its nail-biting double overtime against Kansas and the final Kentucky match (in which Texas Western squared off against future NBA coach Pat Riley, among others). Glory Road
 really isn�t a bad show � it�s just an obvious one � and one wishes material of this historical import had received a more refined rendering.
