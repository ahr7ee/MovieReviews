      <text>At the end of the Belle �poque, Colette wrote of Madame L�a de Lonval and her �big blue wandering eyes,� but one can�t really imagine anything wandering about Michelle Pfeiffer. (Big blue, for sure, but wandering?) Beneath that ethereal coo of a voice, she has a signature sharpness, the impression of hard angles swathed in a deceptively delicate frame; even in collapse � and she�s had some mighty swoons in The Age of Innocence
 and Frears' Dangerous Liaisons
 � there�s fixedness and control. They don�t make women, sexy but regal, like Pfeiffer much anymore, and Cheri
 is quite a monument to her. (Good on that, because not only do they not make women like that anymore, they don�t hire them to top-bill major motion pictures, either.) Here, as a courtesan aging out of an industry and an epoch, Pfeiffer is enmeshed in another dangerous liaison, this one with the child of a once fellow, now former, courtesan named Madame Peloux, who is played by the sporting but still miscast Kathy Bates. (Onetime Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg, who knows a thing or two about driving men wild, pops up as another retired courtesan.) Peloux�s son, Ch�ri (Friend), is spoiled, unformed, and 30-plus years L�a�s junior. L�a takes him on initially as a project, a twilight-years lark � call it expiration-date dating � and Ch�ri is content to coast through the relationship as with everything else in his overindulged and underloved life. But it isn't until their forced separation, when Ch�ri allows his mother to arrange a marriage for him, that the true depths of Ch�ri and L�a�s feelings for each other emerge � complex feelings colored by real-world concerns of practicality, propriety, and the tragic mismatch of their birthdates (and what a pleasure to watch a romantic drama in which the recognition of love, the simple statement of fact, doesn�t mark the end-reel waltz into ever-after). This is sensual, cerebral, and surprisingly weighty stuff, which should come as no surprise to anyone who�s been following the careers of Frears, critically neglected, perhaps, because he�s so hard to pin down (good luck tracking a CV that�s gone from My Beautiful Laundrette
 to beautiful Grifters
 and The Queen
 in a public relations crisis), and his screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, who can add Colette to the list of authors � Graham Greene, Ian McEwan, Joseph Conrad � he�s done right by. Only in its last moments does Cheri
 faintly bobble, with an overpacked final confrontation, no room for reflection, and a rushed coda. That epilogue is something of a cheat, really � it plucks Ch�ri�s fate from Colette�s follow-up novella, the aptly named The Last of Ch�ri
, but doesn�t divulge L�a�s, which was to age, inevitably, into �a broad back and the padded cushion of a fat neck beneath a head of thick grey vigorous hair.� Then again, Pfeiffer with a fat neck? Like anybody'd believe that.
