      <text>Despite a rotten title and a bottomless reserve of cynical, scattershot humor, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard
 is a swift-moving, equal-opportunity offender about a team of used-car liquidators hired to save a Temecula, Calif., dealership from bankruptcy with a Fourth of July weekend blowout sale. Deriving much of its energy from Piven�s tightly wound Don Ready, head of the liquidation crew, the film flings about insults and crass jokes with the abandon of a more Middle-American-seeming Ari Gold (Piven�s character on Entourage
). Although it treads much of the same ground, this comedy is no Used Cars
, the 1980 standard-bearer of car-dealership comedies. However, The Goods
� retreads ought to pick up some quick mileage at the box office before running out of gas. Ready, whose business card reads, �I Move Cars, Motherfucker,� is contacted while eating breakfast in a strip club with his three-person crew (Rhames, Koechner, and Hahn). Off they go to Temecula, despite carrying (as they so tastefully describe it) the stink of customers left over from their just-completed job. Once there, they find a car lot whose characters are just as screwed up as they are, only in different, less cynical ways. Ben Selleck (Brolin), the owner of Temecula�s Selleck Motors, gets an instant hard-on for Ready�s loan specialist Brent Gage (Koechner), his daughter Ivy (Spiro) is engaged to a doofus from the town�s import-car scion (Helms), and his son Peter (Riggle) is a 10-year-old boy trapped in a 30-year-old man�s body. Much humor is derived from the sexual overtures Babs (Hahn) makes toward the boy. An unbilled Will Ferrell, a co-producer along with Gary Sanchez Productions partners Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, also makes a goofy extended cameo. First-time director Brennan manages to keep a tight rein on this galloping sprawl, a strategy he may have honed as a writer and producer of the brilliant but chaotic Chappelle�s Show
. The film�s tone, however, never fully congeals. The script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson (Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach
) can, at times, be a nasty piece of work, and no amount of laughter will fully obscure the gag reflex that occasionally forms in the back of your throat.
