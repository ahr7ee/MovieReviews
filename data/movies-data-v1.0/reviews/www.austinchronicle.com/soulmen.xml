      <text>It�s a rare movie that can be summed up by a throwaway line spoken by one of its throwaway characters. But for the life of me, I can�t think of a better way to describe Soul Men
 than to say it�s about two men who, as one supporting player puts it, �say �motherfucker� a lot.� Louis Hinds (Jackson) and Floyd Henderson (Mac) do say �motherfucker� a lot � mainly in anger, mainly at each other, and always with the baroque eloquence most actors save for Shakespeare � but Jackson and Mac have mastered in service of the more low-down arts. In their defense, Hinds and Henderson have a lot to curse about. Thirty years ago, they were back-up singers in a top-selling soul trio called Marcus Hooks &amp; the Real Deal (fronted, in �historical� newsreel footage, by real-life top-selling soul singer John Legend). Then Hooks left to start a solo career, make millions, and become a pop hero, leaving his two former partners to slip slowly into obscurity and depression and, in Hinds� case, a life of crime and poverty. Flash forward to the present day: Hooks has died, a star-studded tribute concert is being arranged in his honor at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and Hinds and Hooks, who haven�t spoken in years and whose dancing and singing abilities have been diminished by the forces of time and disuse, are on their way to New York to grab a little bit of the celebrity life back for themselves before their time is up. Along the way, they engage in all manner of cheap Hollywood preposterousness � including a ridiculous line-dance set-piece in an Amarillo honky-tonk and a jailbreak that makes the Memphis Police Department look about as capable as Roscoe P. Coltrane from The Dukes of Hazzard
 TV show � straining the boundaries of narrative plausibility as they go and gradually becoming less and less funny as their bitterness gets the better of them. Soul Men
, in other words, is pure mediocrity. It�s poorly written and poorly directed (a subplot involving a young woman and her drug-dealing, rapping, no-good boyfriend doesn�t help). But, thankfully for everyone involved, the movie always has Mac and Jackson and their filthy mouths to fall back on. Whenever Soul Men
 is in need of a jolt of energy, these two poets of profanity are always ready with rapid-fire, mean-spirited rants that would make the writers of Deadwood
 blush. Believe what you want about the moral implications of dirty language, but in Jackson�s and Mac�s capable hands, �motherfucker� sounds like sweet soul music.
