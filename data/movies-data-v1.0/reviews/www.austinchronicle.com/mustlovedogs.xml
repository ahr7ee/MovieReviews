      <text>Writer/director Gary David Goldberg pulls out all the "chick" clich�s � from lit to flick � in this truly (dog)craptastic adaptation of the Claire Cook book about a newly divorced preschool teacher named Sarah who tries Internet dating. The film strives for single-lady, "you said it, sister" boosterism � we�re supposed to want to go rah-rah for our hapless heroine (played here by Diane Lane) as she tries, and mostly fails, to get back in the game. But it�s hard to cheer for a film that wears a slight sneer when it comes to its leading lady. Sarah�s sprawling Irish family (led by patriarch Christopher Plummer) treats her like a freak, a basket case, or a punchline. Her adventures in cyberdating produce one humiliation after another. And the neighborhood butcher looks on her with contempt because she�s only buying for one, and then with fear when she gives him a much-deserved dressing-down. The icing on the cake? When that butcher whispers "praise be" when Sarah finally lands a man � one less crazy divorced lady to deal with! And indeed Sarah does find a man. We all know her single-ness is just a brief spell � a bad rash � and that she�s going to have to try all sorts of embarrassing over-the-counter topical creams before she finds the just-right remedy. Must Love Dogs
� soothing balm is played by John Cusack, as a brokenhearted boat-builder. His part is a bore, but at least it doesn�t demand indignity. That honor�s reserved for Lane, a luminous actress who�s forced to dowdy herself down. She�s played a lonelyheart before, in Under the Tuscan Sun
, but there the desperation and despair felt legitimate � and legitimately moving � here, that pain is just the necessary preamble to getting a man, to getting "fixed." They say rah-rah, I say retch
: No film that requires a woman to jump in water and dogpaddle toward a man has the "sisterhood�s" best interests at heart.
