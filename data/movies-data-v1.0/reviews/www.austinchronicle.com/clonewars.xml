      <text>Remember, a long time ago, when the most powerful agent in George Lucas� universe was the Force? Remember how simple and compelling the idea was? A faceless, benevolent energy binding the galaxy together, fueling good and fighting evil, and easily interchangeable with whatever mealy-mouthed spiritual half-traditions audiences were comfortable with? Then came The Phantom Menace
 and Attack of the Clones
 and Revenge of the Sith
, and suddenly the greatest power in Lucas� cosmology wasn�t the Force but endless, grinding exposition spread thick over soulless technological flimflammery, leaving anything resembling wonder or excitement out in the cold. Well, with Lucas� new animated prequel/sequel, The Clone Wars
 (which takes place between the events of Attack
 and Revenge
), there�s a brand-new power rearing its ugly head, and it�s a beast more horrible and more terrifying than Darth Vader could ever hope to be: the tween girl. (It squeals! It texts! It shops! It consumes everything it sees!) In our new tween-dominated star economy, with Miley Cyrus and other Disney Channel starlets printing money, I suppose it was inevitable that the shamelessly market-savvy Lucas would seize an opportunity to do the same. Enter Ahsoka Tano, a sassy young Padawan, or apprentice Jedi, who arrives (looking like a chorus member from The Lion King
 stage show) to study under the future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker, who�s busy leading the clone armies of the Republic against the droid armies of the evil Separatists while trying to secure the safe return of gangster Jabba the Hutt�s infant son, who was kidnapped by Separatist leader and Jedi-gone-spoiled Count Dooku in an attempt to frame the Jedi and convince Jabba to open his trade routes to the Separatist army, thereby clearing the way for total galactic domination � not that any of that matters. Story is entirely insignificant in The Clone Wars
, as it has been in the Star Wars
 universe since the closing credits of Return of the Jedi
. The only important thing is that viewers are blown away by the movie�s endless and pointless laser battles and that young Ahsoka has as much super, sassy, awesome, girl-powered fun as possible bounding about and cutting down droids by the dozen, while still finding time to call Skywalker �Sky Guy,� nickname Jabba�s son �Stinky,� and declare, in the spirit of original teen-girl heroine Barbie, �Being a Padawan is tough.� That and math, Ahsoka, that and math.
