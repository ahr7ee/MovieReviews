      <text>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of computer-animated summer movies for children, it was the age of bland and perfunctory sequels with phoned-in voice work. It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity that the first Garfield
 movie made $75 million and generated a second � a second with not one but two
 CGI cats and an overseas location. Viewers have everything before them (talking farm animals! a sneering villain! topiary hedges! London scenery!) and nothing before them (Meyer and Hewitt are virtually nonexistent, even when they�re onscreen together). There is a cat with a large belly and a love of lasagna (and the voice of Murray) on the throne of his master�s house; there is an identical cat (voice of Curry) on the throne of Carlyle castle, an estate on the upper Thames. There is an inevitable prince-and-the-pauper mix-up; there are fart jokes and lengthy musical interludes to pad the film. There is a Rottweiler to bite repeatedly the crotch of the cats� nemesis (Connolly), a mustache-twirling royal pretender who also takes a ferret up the trousers. All these things, and a thousand like them, come to pass in the film�s 90-minute running time with nary a moment of pleasure. Perfectly respectable English thespians � Bob Hoskins, Jane Horrocks, Richard E. Grant, and Vinnie Jones � are laid to waste voicing the flesh-and-blood animals (Rhys Ifans fares the best as a Scots bunny) while Garfield breakdances. A children�s movie about wily farm animals besting their human enemy and saving their manor might have been worth watching, but what is Garfield doing here? Jim Davis� cartoon strip (and its television incarnations, with voice work by the deadpan Lorenzo Music) isn�t high art, but it at least has a sly charm and a point to make: People are whipped by their pets. It�s about the loving but contentious relationship between cat and man, not about cramming a frame with as many talking animals doing as much wacky shit as possible. A Tail of Two Kitties
 couldn�t care less about its human principals, and all it wants its animals to do is air-guitar to �Cat Scratch Fever� and wear silly sunglasses. It�s sort of the Hollywood equivalent of a Tijuana donkey painted to look like a zebra, but not quite as funny.
