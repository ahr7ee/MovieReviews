After a dark spell, Coens swing back to comedy with 'Burn'
Over the years, the Coen brothers have become the movie equivalent of an inconstant lover. They�re almost always charming and witty and creative, and sometimes they come through with a ��Fargo,�� so for a second you think there might actually be a long-term relationship there. But then they�ll stand you up at a restaurant and laugh at you for getting mad, and you realize that whatever matters to you, it sure doesn�t matter to them.
��Burn After Reading�� stands us up at the restaurant � and things were going so well, too. After being richly rewarded for the dark, uncompromising vision that was last year�s ��No Country for Old Men,�� the Coens have returned to what they like best, which is goofing around with their buddies.
The new film, a slapstick farce in which a number of big Hollywood stars play middle-class boneheads, is set in Washington, D.C. This has led some to seek a political interpretation in the pratfalls; I assure you, no such interpretation exists. John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox, a rageaholic ex-CIA functionary who has written his memoirs, hoping they�ll burn Langley down. Instead, the disc containing the manuscript ends up in the possession of two idiot health-club employees, Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand).
They decide to shake Osborne down, threatening to take the information to the Russians if he doesn�t play ball. (The vaguely embarrassed expression on a cultural attache at the Russian embassy is one of the movie�s better jokes.) Working at cross-purposes to these three are Osborne�s unhappy wife (Tilda Swinton) and her macho twit of a boyfriend (George Clooney).
The computer disc is a MacGuffin, as is the entire plot, really; the entertainment here lies in watching these dumdums twist in their own wind. ��Burn After Reading�� is a character comedy, which means everyone behaves like a character. McDormand does rabbity things with her teeth, turning Linda into a self-obsessed, oversexed nerd who can�t stop thinking about the plastic surgery she thinks she needs. Clooney, meanwhile, acts with his throat; his character isn�t sure what foods he�s allergic to and keeps teetering phlegmily on the verge of anaphylactic shock.
Malkovich bellows and swears (he�s been given Steve Buscemi�s speech patterns from ��Fargo��), while Swinton plays an ice-cold control freak � nothing new there. Richard Jenkins, as McDormand�s boss, pines for her with sad-clown eyes, or perhaps he�s missing his role from ��The Visitor.�� Pitt � well, actually, Pitt�s hilarious. Chad is the one person here not stomping around in a foul mood only because he�s too stupid to get angry. Each new idea seems like the first idea Chad has ever had; the act of thinking itself fills him with awe.
Pitt�s also the only performer here whose shtick seems to rise from character rather than the other way around. ��Burn After Reading�� is shallow and proud of it, an antic cartoon that lacks the comic inspiration to go the distance. The biggest laughs don�t even come from the main characters but from a pair of deadpan CIA suits (J.K. Simmons and David Rasche) who regularly brief each other on the increasingly preposterous goings-on. They could be the Coens themselves snarking away at their characters. In a way, that�s the real show.
I suppose the filmmakers have earned a break. Heck, after ��No Country,�� we�ve earned a break. But the difference between ��Burn After Reading�� and much better Coen comedies like ��Raising Arizona,�� ��Fargo,�� and ��O Brother, Where Art Thou?�� is that the brothers� smugness has finally gone over the top. Perhaps winning acclaim and Oscars will do that, but never has one of their movies seemed like such an inside joke. ��Burn�� is a party to which the audience isn�t invited, its unheard soundtrack the Coens� nervous hermetic giggles.
Way back when they got started, with 1984�s ��Blood Simple,�� the Coens were able to take a dinky story of greed and ineptness and spin it into an epic. ��Burn�� manages the opposite: Despite the D.C. setting and international-espionage backdrop, the film�s pointless enough to make you suspect the artistic maturity of ��No Country for Old Men�� may have been just another pose. Whatever talents the Coens possess, ��Burn After Reading�� reminds us that ��meaning it�� may never be one of them.
