Maybe it�s a cheap shot to call ��The Kingdom�� ���Syriana� for Dummies,�� but it�s fairly close to the truth.
A taut, slickly made thriller about an FBI team solving a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, the film stars Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, is directed by the actor-turned-director Peter Berg (��Friday Night Lights��), and has been produced by Michael Mann.
That�s telling; the movie presents a Mann�s man�s world of international politics. ��The Kingdom�� is a provocative, visceral experience, an undeniable crowd-pleaser that at certain points will have audiences loudly cheering on the heroes. More thoughtful moviegoers may wonder what exactly it is they�re cheering for.
It�s possible that�s part of the game plan, of course � using a hard-boiled action flick as a Trojan horse to pick apart our assumptions and anxieties about the Middle East. If so, the horse x has a tendency to bolt.
A US base in Saudi Arabia � the desert kingdom of the title � has been bombed, a two-pronged attack that has resulted in the deaths of US civilians and rescue personnel. (The incident is based on an actual 1996 bombing.) The country�s ruling sheiks insist the investigation can be handled internally, but a group of FBI field agents led by Ronald Fleury (Foxx) bull their way in-country against every instinct of the State Department (represented most memorably by Jeremy Piven as an Ari-inflected bureaucrat).
Fleury�s team includes forensics expert Janet Mayes (Garner) and bomb specialists Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), all suppressing their connect-the-dot differences for the greater good of the mission. One of the dead was an FBI colleague, and they�re beside themselves with grief and rage.
Indeed, simmering righteousness is the motor that propels both characters and ��Kingdom�� forward, through obstacles tossed up by US diplomats, intransigent Saudis, Muslim terrorists, and endless cultural differences that the movie both respects and dismisses.
Fleury�s group is assigned a Saudi police escort/babysitter in the person of Colonel Faris Al-Ghazi, a cautious, sad-eyed figure played by the fine Israeli actor Ashraf Barhom (��The Syrian Bride��). His job is to keep the Americans from getting underfoot � to stall them, essentially � but, of course, everyone ends up working side by side. While we�re meant to sympathize primarily with the agents, Barhom gives Al-Ghazi�s hard-won decency a charisma that outlasts the movie. You come out wanting to see more of the character and of this actor.
Not that Foxx, Garner, Cooper, or Bateman are slouches � Garner in particular seems happy to be out of chick flicks and back in government service � but their characters are hemmed in by the conventions of Hollywood action-dramas. ��The Kingdom�� has a lot on its mind: it�s a police procedural, a culture clash, a Team America morale booster, a statement on the futility of violence � and an example of Hollywood big-screen violence at its most brutal and alluring.
Shot with the jittery propulsiveness associated more with Mann�s films than Berg�s, ��Kingdom�� builds in momentum until it boils over in a climactic sequence that batters and elates both characters and audience. Terrifically filmed, emotionally suspect, the last half hour pits the heroes against an entire neighborhood of terrorist sympathizers, culminating in a pitched hand-to-hand battle that could wring a war whoop from a Buddhist.
To what end, though? ��The Kingdom�� addresses our fears of a hostile foreign culture � our dread that American certainty and might can�t fix things this time � but it does so in the limited language of the multiplex. The movie ends on a plaintive can�t-we-all-get-along note, but at heart it�s a Charles Bronson flick. It mashes the revenge button the real world won�t let us push.
