Hands up, those of you who saw 2004�s zombie farce ��Shaun of the Dead.�� You know the drill: A comic British take on a lowbrow Hollywood genre � not quite Python-surreal, but smart and fast and playing by the rules while insisting on a sort of comfortable English shabbiness. Very funny, very cheeky, just gory enough.
Now apply that template and much of the key personnel to two-cop action flicks, add some warm Guinness, and � voila � ��Hot Fuzz.�� It�s to the ��Lethal Weapon�� movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge.
Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg, who co-wrote the script with director Edgar Wright, both ��Shaun of the Dead�� vets) is the best bobby in London � so annoyingly rule-conscious that his superiors pack him off to the countryside so he won�t make them look bad. Re-assigned to the sleepy town of Sandford, Angel spends his first evening ID-ing the lads down the pub and putting one particularly drunken lout in the tank. Bad news: the lout is Police Constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), son of Chief Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent) and Nick�s new partner.
Nick�s a by-the-book martinet, Danny�s a wide-eyed blob, and the duo spend more time chasing down the vicar�s swan than pursuing suspects � all familiar comic territory, and thanks to whoever put the Kinks� ��Village Green�� on the soundtrack. ��Hot Fuzz�� keeps things percolating, though, by introducing us to the townspeople, played by a roster of slumming British talent.
There�s Broadbent, of course, and a one-time James Bond, Timothy Dalton, as a smarmy local retailer. Billie Whitelaw (Sam Beckett�s muse, if you�re keeping score) pops up as the publican�s wife. Look fast for Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, Cate Blanchett, and ��Lord of the Rings�� director Peter Jackson as a homicidal Santa Claus. All keep admirably straight faces even when they�re losing their heads.
For it wouldn�t be a cozy English hamlet without a mad killer on the loose. Despite the big guns and stray bits of ultra-violence, ��Hot Fuzz�� has its heart in the garden-party whodunnits of yore (see 1946�s ��Green for Danger,�� just out on DVD, with its murders in a country hospital). At the same time, Danny knows Nick will never be a true crime-fighter without a few late-night screenings of ��Bad Boys 2.�� It�s a matter of balance, innit?
��Hot Fuzz�� is so disarming you forgive its lapses, like the handful of spurting-blood scenes that feel tonally wrong and on loan from ��Shaun of the Dead.�� The movie overstays its welcome, too, but just as the fun�s turning tedious, Pegg, Frost, and Wright say sod it all and deliver a grandstanding action climax, complete with exploding cars, slow-motion shotgun recoils, and pistol-packing parsons. It�s ��Dirty Harry�� in the Home Counties � macho action with a spot of tea � and it is blissfully silly.
