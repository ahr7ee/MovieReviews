Cardboard characters and severe problems of tone fatally flaw the awkward satirical relationship drama �The Private Lives of Pippa Lee.� Fourth feature from helmer-writer Rebecca Miller (�The Ballad of Jack and Rose,� �Personal Velocity,� �Angela�) feels as schizophrenic as its eponymous heroine. �Reinvented� from Miller�s own novel, this star-studded tale of a 50ish married woman coming to terms with her troubled past reps something of a pig-in-a-poke for buyers who nabbed presales rights. While watchable, it�s not exactly a commercial property or, for that matter, arthouse material, and thus reps a marketing challenge unlikely to receive critical support.
The story opens with Pippa (Robin Wright Penn, with a perpetually placid smile), hosting a dinner party with Stepford wife-like perfection at the Connecticut retirement community she�s just moved into with much older publisher hubby Herb (Alan Arkin). As guests hail her as a model spouse, her inner voice confides, �I�ve lived more than one life.�
Introduced by Pippa�s voiceover, those other lives are revealed in a wannabe picaresque style and intercut with the Lees� present-day existence in �Wrinklesbury.� We see Pippa growing up with manic, diet-pill-popping mother (Maria Bello) and running away at 16 (played by Blake Lively) to join lesbian aunt Trish (Robin Weigert) and Trish�s �dangerous� lover Kat (Julianne Moore), whose sideline taking S&amp;M porn photos generates a chuckle.
Pippa�s memories of the past and the guilt she feels, particularly over an incident involving Herb�s wacko second wife (Monica Bellucci), start to create a �quiet nervous breakdown� in which she acts out repressed urges in her sleep. Luckily, she finds a confidante of sorts in her neighbor�s son Chris (Keanu Reeves).
While the film marks a change of pace from the intense seriousness of Miller�s earlier work, she never finds the dark comic edge that would make �Pippa� more satisfying viewing. Indeed, she never sustains any tone at all. The dialogue teeters from flat comedy to wince-worthy whimsy, with detours through blithe and earnest. Visual style, too, is all over the place.
Although Pippa declares, �I�ve had enough of being an enigma, I want to be known,� she�s not developed enough for viewers to really care. Likewise, the supporting characters are paper-thin. Of the actors, only Bello and Moore offer a suggestion of the over-the-top thesping the story seems to call for. Reeves (who offered phenomenal character work in �Thumbsucker�) hasn�t got much to do here other than look good with a big tattoo of Jesus on his chest.
Tech package seems a tad constricted. Lenser Declan Quinn and production designer Michael Shaw suggest the story�s multiple time periods, the camera drifting from one set to the next. Period music does a better job of evoking the era than the laughable costumes, hair and makeup.
