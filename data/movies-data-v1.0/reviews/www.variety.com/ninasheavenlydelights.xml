There's more simmering on the backburner than scrumptious Indian food in "Nina's Heavenly Delights," a Glasgow-set quasi-fairy tale� incorporating a trio of cross-cultural romances (gay, lesbian, straight) en route to a televised curry competition. Stereotypes abound, dialogue is conventional and pace scattered. Still, resulting stew is pleasant. Local color-drenched Sept. 29 release in the U.K. is the kind of venture critics often dislike and audiences often enjoy. The food is hotter than the implied sex, but gay fests may still be tempted. 
Three years after Indo-Scottish Nina Shah (Shelley Conn) ditched fiance Sanjay (Raji James), she returns to Glasgow for her beloved father's funeral. Dad's curry palace may fall to rivals unless Nina excels in the "Best of the West" cooking finals. Nina and fellow chef Lisa (Laura Fraser) are soon using their tongues on more than recipes. Overt or covert, each member of ensemble cast craves something. "Forbidden" loves abound, right down to Nina's little sister's incongruous passion for Scottish Highland dance. Silly musical numbers, courtesy of Nina's flamboyant Bollywood-obsessed drag queen friend Bobbi (Ronny Jhutti), add to the good-natured ambiance of the non-threatening transgressions.
