Twists abound in the otherwise derivative "Ten 'Til Noon," as several characters' final 10 minutes on earth are replayed from six different points of view, with each shift in perspective supplying a sordid new twist. Paul Osborne's script delivers an intriguing structure, though dialogue tastes like something warmed over after 12 years in Quentin Tarantino's freezer. Cheap on style and clumsy in the acting department, Scott Storm's sophomore effort languished on the festival circuit, but is likely to attract its share of thick-skinned devotees on DVD.
Pic begins promptly at 11:50 a.m. as a loquacious hitman (Alfonso Freeman, son of Morgan) informs unsuspecting Larry Taylor (Rick D. Wasserman) he has 10 minutes to live. It's an awfully long time to wait listening to "Pulp Fiction" leftovers, considering the aud has no reason to root for either character, nor care who survives. As promised, by noon, the blood is on the wall, and the movie is off to shadow the next set of characters' late-morning misadventures. Their sleazy vignettes should entice some, repel most, until the mystery implodes. Of the cast, only Uma Thurman-like Jenya Lano manages to keep her cool.
