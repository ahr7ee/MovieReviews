Stylishly made, armed to the teeth and ludicrous in the extreme, �Max Payne� sends its eponymous antihero into New York�s underbelly on a deranged quest for revenge. Along the way, director John Moore unleashes every visual trick in his arsenal, the flashiest being a hail of bullets that whoosh across the screen in delirious slow-motion -- no doubt to distract auds from an increasingly risible story involving tattooed corpses, Norse mythology, demonic hallucinations and perhaps the weirdest cinematic reference yet to the �war on terror.� Fans of the popular vidgame franchise and Mark Wahlberg should ensure brawny B.O. and ancillary returns.
As reconceived for the screen by first-time scribe Beau Thorne, New York detective Max Payne bears some temperamental similarities to the gifted sniper Wahlberg played in last year�s �Shooter.� Like Bob Lee Swagger, Max is a laconic, disgruntled badass who�s handy with a gun, lives in self-imposed exile (he�s transferred himself to the NYPD�s cold-cases department) and winds up on the run, accused of a murder he didn�t commit.
Make that two murders. The first victim is a voluptuous Russian babe, Natasha (Olga Kurylenko), whose unique body art provides a clue as to who, or what, was responsible for her brutal dismemberment. The second victim is the cop (Donal Logue) who was assigned to the still-unsolved murders of Max�s wife, Michelle (Marianthi Evans, seen in flashback), and their young child.
Determined to avenge his family, Max teams up with Natasha�s less trashy, more trigger-happy sister, Mona Sax (Mila Kunis, �Forgetting Sarah Marshall�) and seeks sympathetic advice from ex-cop BB Hensley (Beau Bridges), now a top exec at Aesir, the major pharmaceutical company where Michelle used to work. It�s here that �Max Payne� goes quite literally to Hell, as the disillusioned detective realizes a link between Aesir and the pushers of a powerfully addictive drug that induces fiery visions of winged, Valkyrie-like demons. And you thought �The Constant Gardener� was scary.
Before it derails with a climax that seems to have borrowed a few scenes from the �The Incredible Hulk,� �Max Payne� strives valiantly to imbue its hoary vigilante-thriller cliches and police-procedural tropes with authentic grit and emotion. But a fleeting mention of the Iraq War amounts to little more than a pseudo-topical feint (proof that the U.S.-Mideast conflict is officially ripe for action-pic exploitation), and scenes meant to emotionally anchor the drama are dashed off with perfunctory haste. Not helping matters is Wahlberg�s guarded performance, which (somewhat surprisingly, given the subtle shadings of personality the actor displayed in �Shooter�) fails to make Max Payne the character much of an improvement on Max Payne the avatar.
The 2001 videogame and its 2003 sequel were notable for their innovative third-person-shooter interface -- heavily influenced by the balletic action on display in �The Matrix� and the films of John Woo -- which allowed players to slow down time while firing and dodging bullets. Fans will be duly impressed with how the pic incorporates the gimmick, though needless to say, it�s not nearly as much fun as actually playing the game.
Moore, whose strong compositional eye enlivened such otherwise routine action fare as �Flight of the Phoenix� and �Behind Enemy Lines,� artfully blends vidgame and film-noir aesthetics (dramatic overhead camera angles, intense use of chiaroscuro, bursts of red onscreen to emphasize the impact of the violence), while editor Dan Zimmerman�s measured rhythms yield a more coherent, less frenzied work than one might expect from the source material. 
Daniel T. Dorrance�s urban-grunge production design and Jonathan Sela�s shadowy widescreen lensing of various Toronto locations add up to a reasonably convincing and atmospheric simulacrum of the game�s interactive environment before the visual overload of the final scenes. Post-credits sequence promises the obligatory unrequested sequel.
