Already one of the top five all-time grossers in Mexico, and seemingly a sure thing for Stateside arthouse success, �Rudo y Cursi� reunites �Y tu mama tambien� stars Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal under the direction of �Mama� screenwriter Carlos Cuaron for a rags-to-riches parable powered by football, delirious vulgarity and pure personality. Produced by the Cha Cha Cha Films triumvirate of Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and the helmer�s brother Alfonso, pic scores a solid goal for its national cinema and the cause of comedy. 
Set on a banana plantation somewhere in rustic Mexico, Cuaron�s script doesn�t pussyfoot around his country�s class distinctions. Stepbrothers Beto (Luna) and Tato (Bernal) are hicks; their mother seems to collect men with unerring misjudgment, and their family life is one of squabbling, children, beer and a blind devotion to soccer. While Tato dreams of going north to become a singer (he can�t sing), the earthier and more volatile Beto just wants to make a living in bananas. But during a local pickup game, a sports agent with the apt handle of �Baton� (the comically oily Guillermo Francella) shows up in his sports car and makes the boys an offer: He�ll take one of them to Mexico City and get him into bigtime soccer. But only one. 
And so begins a rivalry that continues through twin careers that travel a dirt road of undreamed-of success, habitual gambling, drugs, bimbos and gangsters. It�s clear where the pic is going; getting there is all the fun. 
Bernal and Luna are longtime friends, and their chemistry is perfection, even when the two brothers are at each other�s throats. Upon arriving in Mexico City, where he�s introduced to graft, hazing and the rude realities of cutthroat, major league sports, the belligerent Beto is given the nickname Rudo (�tough�), and the sweeter Tato is dubbed Cursi (�corny�). That Cursi has the more flamboyant and successful career on the field makes Rudo (a goalie) a bit crazy, but he has his moments, too, and their problems and peccadilloes mount as the film makes its way toward the inevitable climactic game.
�Rudo y Cursi� is, not surprisingly, a writer�s movie, but Cuaron uses his less-than-startling visual flair to his advantage: Very little soccer shows up onscreen. What we get are reactions to what�s allegedly happening, and it turns out to be much funnier than if the pic had supplied footage and voiceover.
If there�s a bone to be picked, it�s with the pic�s moral lesson: Don�t reach above your station in life, it seems to say, because you�re bound to become a victim of your own appetites and ego. We�ve seen it all too often before. Fortunately, �Rudo y Cursi� isn�t about sociology; it�s about creating a comic showpiece for two young actors who virtually pop off the screen. 
Production values are appropriately rough.
