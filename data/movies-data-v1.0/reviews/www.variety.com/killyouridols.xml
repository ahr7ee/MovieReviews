Nostalgia ain't what it used to be, according to both young and old musicians in S.A. Crary's "Kill Your Idols." Niftily edited docu reps a look back at Gotham's early-'80s No Wave scene, recollected by such key performers as Lydia Lunch, Sonic Youth and Swans, followed by a snapshot of their heirs, the latest crop of hip young bands including the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, A.R.E. Weapons and Gogol Bordello. Pic doesn't have the crossover appeal of recent music-themed docus like "Metallica: Some Kind of Monster," but could find worshippers as a micro-niche release.
Original interviews by the outspoken No Wavers, still full of piss and vinegar, are supplemented by vintage concert footage shot by Richard Kern and others. "We were just trying to be monsters," says Suicide's Martin Rev, remembering the time's dissonant vibe. Younger artists featured come across as less politically engaged or savvy, apart from the articulate Eugene Hutz of Gogol Bordello. The oldies diss the youngsters; the youngsters diss each other; everyone disses the Strokes. Pic leaves a curiously sour aftertaste, though tech credits are polished.
Camera (color, DigiBeta), Crary. Oct. 24, 2004.  Running time: 75 MIN.
