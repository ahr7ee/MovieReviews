Rating less than zero on the sophistication scale, �The Informers� is thus a totally faithful adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis� novel -- and an accurate look at early �80s-era Los Angeles. Stumbling alongside wasted cases at the top and bottom of the economic ladder -- from Billy Bob Thornton�s near-catatonic studio exec to Mickey Rourke�s lollipop-sucking kidnapper -- the film is banal by obvious intent. The only question, as with other Ellis adaptations including �American Psycho,� is whether auds will appreciate the aggressively shallow depiction of an aggressively shallow milieu, or mistake the pic�s implicit critique for the crime itself. April 10 release will tell.
Dedicated to the late Brad Renfro, who appears briefly as one of many gorgeous young zombies, �The Informers� opens with fast-motion shots of L.A. at night, but otherwise stretches time (and, no doubt, the patience of some) to mirror a warped, woozy morning after in the days when sushi, Spago and MTV were new, cocaine was ubiquitous and Ray-Bans were worn by all. Pic�s subject of rampant superficiality threatens to make it beyond reproach, though the fundamental authenticity of chic boredom here can�t easily be denied.
Standouts in the ensemble cast include Kim Basinger as the executive�s pill-popping wife Laura, who enjoys ogling her shirtless pool boy until he pulls out a rat, and Winona Ryder as Laura�s TV-newscasting rival for the spotty attention of hubby William (Thornton). Lead rich kid Graham is played with aptly ruthless longing by James Spader lookalike Jon Foster. As gravel-voiced bottom-feeder Peter, Rourke is resplendent in a full tan, Hawaiian shirt and porkpie hat, though his relatively minor role doesn�t capitalize on his opponent-pinning perf in �The Wrestler.�
Flaunting its pointed lack of plot from the outset, the film has a pretty boy in a pink blazer being run over and killed by a fellow partygoer in the first reel; then, as if as listless and jaded as its characters, it moves on to fresher meat. 
Another enjoyably inconsequential scene features a British post-punk star swilling vodka in an ice tub, stepping out to light a cig, slipping on the floor and hitting broken glass while a telephone rings incessantly. Director Gregor Jordan (�Buffalo Soldiers�) stages these lurid incidents -- not least a menage-a-trois set to dumb, synth-driven music spilling from a TV -- to emphasize the utterly squandered privilege of the cake-eating participants.
The totally awesome soundtrack includes period hits from Simple Minds, Men Without Hats, A Flock of Seagulls, Devo and Wang Chung -- which, like the film proper, deliver guilty pleasures aplenty while helping to capture the vapid spirit of the times. Tech credits are vividly handsome on all levels.
