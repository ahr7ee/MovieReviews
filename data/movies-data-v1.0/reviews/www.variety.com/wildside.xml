Sex frequently disguises itself as friendship and love in "Wild Side," a morbid and self-important homosexual "Jules &amp; Jim" for the new millennium. Mistaking silence for significance, Gallic helmer Sebastien Lifshitz lets long periods roll by without dialogue, but his intention to shock is unmistakable, with one genital close-up, one anal penetration and two acts of fellatio in the first few minutes. Gay fests are pic's obvious destination, though distribs looking for sensationalism may also be rewarded.
After the aforementioned sexual imagery, pic begins with pre-op transsexual Stephanie (Stephanie Michelini) receiving a phone call at her Paris apartment that mom is dying. She returns to her home village in northern France, taking along one of her live-in lovers, Mikhail (Edouard Nikitine), a non-Francophone Russian emigre. The other one, Jamel (Yasmine Belmadi), continues cruising railroad stations for sex with anyone who'll pay him, and then also makes the trip north. Childhood flashbacks do little to elucidate the feelings below Stephanie's stoic face and other narrative-time shuffles only disrupt the flow. Perfs are largely cold and detached; Agnes Godard's lensing is exquisite but wasted, and other tech credits are good.
Camera (color, widescreen), Agnes Godard; editor, Stephanie Mahet; music, Joceyln Pook; art director, Veronique Mellery; costume designer, Elizabeth Mehu. Reviewed at Berlin Film Festival (Panorama), Feb. 8, 2004. French, English, Russian dialogue. Running time: 94 MIN.
