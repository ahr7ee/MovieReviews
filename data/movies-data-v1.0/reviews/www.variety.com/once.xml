Two actual Dublin singer-songwriters of as-yet minor renown play fictive ones in "Once," which took the World Cinema Audience Award at Sundance. Winningly unpretentious tale uses a wispy romantic narrative as a vehicle for attractive original tunes. Pic's charm seems so offhand one might not notice the skill with which helmer John Carney pulls it off, or how it plays like a full-blown musical without anyone bursting into song. Picked up for world rights minus Ireland by Summit Entertainment, "Once" will require outreach to folk/alt-rock fans to realize offshore sleeper potential.
A mid-30s man ID'd only as "Guy" (Glen Hansard) still works and lives above his father's vacuum repair shop, busking downtown in off-hours, hoping for a music-biz break. One day he's approached by a pretty Czech immigrant "Girl" (Marketa Irglova), who supports her mother and child -- the father remains back home -- selling roses to shoppers. She, too, is a musician-songwriter. When Guy gets past her initial pushiness, he finds both an artistic collaborator and a frustrating love object. Soon they're drafting other players for a marathon recording sesh. Natural thesping and appealing music make the whole enterprise a low-key charmer.
 Camera (color), Tim Fleming; editor, Paul Mullen; music, Glen Hansard, Marketa Irglova; production designer, Tamara Conboy. Reviewed at Sundance Film Festival (competing), Jan. 20, 2007. Running time:  86 MIN.
