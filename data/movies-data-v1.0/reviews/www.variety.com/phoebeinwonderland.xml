Elle Fanning starrer �Phoebe in Wonderland� is a live-action entry in the little-girl-fantasy genre that, like the puppet-animated �Coraline� (toplining Fanning�s sister Dakota), stresses both the wonders and the terrors of the imagination. Phoebe is differently enabled -- also beautiful, wistful and fey, as portrayed by Fanning. Whenever tyro writer-director Daniel Barnz sticks to his luminous star, his script�s blatant inconsistency reads as willful ambiguity. Whenever he vainly fleshes out Phoebe�s reality/fantasy axis, the unfocused pic founders in bathetic whimsy. Pic grossed $26,111 in its 11-screen debut over the weekend.
Nine-year-old Phoebe suffers from Tourette syndrome, a fact coyly unrevealed until the pic�s denouement; the filmmaker, apparently, is as reluctant as Phoebe�s mother (Felicity Huffman) to accept �reductive� labels (though once Phoebe is pigeonholed, she can smilingly show-and-tell her disease in class). The syndrome manifests itself at school in antisocial behavior of a remarkably genteel bent (rarely has spitting been accomplished with such a minimum of phlegm and a maximum of provocation), and at home in more serious, self-destructive rituals, leaving Phoebe with night terrors and bloody hands and knees.
Phoebe is given the lead role in a school production of �Alice in Wonderland,� ringmastered by a quaintly garbed, �Jabberwocky�-spouting drama teacher (Patricia Clarkson). This unleashes a scattershot barrage of quotes, cheesy hallucinations, circular pans and archly pretentious�Wonderland� comparisons (with Phoebe�s shrink, played by Peter Gerety, recast as a lamely costumed Humpty Dumpty), the already tenuous lines between reality and fantasy blurrily evaporating.  
In �Heavenly Creatures,� �Coraline� or the peerless �Pan�s Labyrinth,� a girl�s entrance into a parallel universe symbolizes a deep sea change into something rich and strange; here, it signals a mishmash of motley agendas and trendy causes that contradict themselves.  
Partly produced by Lifetime, the pic attempts to elevate the disease-of-the-week movie into a moral dialectic between conformity and imagination. Political correctness -- the view of mental illness as an extension of normal behavior -- trumps any narrative logic. Thus, Barnz arbitrarily posits a nonsensical series of school �rules� to embody conformity, while imagination is repped by Tourette syndrome.
For extra credit, Barnz throws in simplistically overwrought feminism: Huffman shrilly complains of the difficulty of reconciling work and motherhood, while Bill Pullman�s uninspired turn as Phoebe�s dad adds a touch of male cluelessness to the mix. Indeed, few adult actors manage to overcome the pic�s skewed point-making, Campbell Scott�s hilarious spin on a babbling, responsibility-avoiding principal being a notable exception.
This sorry straggler from last year�s Sundance Film Festival peaks with a wince-worthy New Age update of Andy Hardy, as Phoebe�s playmates learn the value of individuality by rote repetition of �I�m responsible!,� capped by a musical number of staggering unoriginality.
