Like its sister films in the surfing-movie genre, the extreme-skiing movie �Steep� is less a documentary than a sales pitch -- not for a product or a place, but for a sport, one its practitioners feel requires pugnacious self-promotion. Spectacular alpine landscapes, suicidal descents on 70-degree mountainsides and skiers with an inflated sense of self (and no sense of self-preservation) will make for a cultish theatrical release and -- given that the doc already seems cut for commercial interruptions -- a reasonable life on TV and DVD. 
Given the risks involved (extreme skiers purposefully choose the most dangerous, inaccessible, sharply pitched and unstable surfaces in the world), �Steep� is willfully blind to the questions it inevitably raises, such as: Why? Why do these men -- and except for the heartstopping Ingrid Backstrom, the film is a virtually all-male endeavor -- do what they do? There�s a lot of blather about the mountain making them come alive, but considering how many people die on the slopes, the viewer really wants a little less of the gnarly dudes and something closer to a professional diagnosis.
To the strains of Anton Sanko�s often oppressive faux-metal soundtrack, �Steep� doesn�t really advertise skiing so much as skiing films (even though ski-film godfather Warren Miller isn�t mentioned). Very little of what goes on in the sport isn�t recorded and made commercially available, so in a way, pic reps a kind of porn -- in which people engage in senseless, life-threatening and therefore obscene acts of titillation for viewers who will be watching it from the less-than-alpine altitude of their couches. 
Marking the birth of extreme skiing from Bill Briggs� seemingly impossible descent of the Grand Tetons in 1971, the film touches on a number of sports luminaries, some crazier than others, much like the stunts: The scariest jump in the movie doesn�t even take place in snow, but rather over a river, as Shane McConkey -- who combines skiing and parachuting -- leaps off a bridge and plummets for what seems like a mile before opening his chute and gently gliding toward earth. 
 �Steep� has its moments. Some are exhilarating, others seemingly insane. But the movie also feels like a sermon. The featured skiers protest too much about the value of what they do, sounding as if they�re defending and ultimately trying to ennoble it. But they�re not curing cancer; they�re sliding down hills on two sticks. It should be fun. So should �Steep.� 
Production values are phenomenal.
