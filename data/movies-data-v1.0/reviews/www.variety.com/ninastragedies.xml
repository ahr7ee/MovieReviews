An amiable, but cluttered dramedy, "Nina's Tragedies" casts an ambitious net that ultimately falls out of the control of writer-director Savi Gabizon. Likable perfs by a strong ensemble cast carry well-made pic (last year's official Israeli Oscar entry) up to a point, and it's easy to see "Nina" traveling far on the fest circuit and perhaps even into arthouses with large Jewish auds.
Pic -- about the chaotic confluence of people and politics in modern-day Israel -- is narrated by a precocious teenage boy, Nadav (Aviv Elkabets). He is consumed by an impossible crush on his aunt Nina (Ayelet July Zurer), whose husband recently died. Pic takes off in a myriad of directions, from a soldier who has a crush on Nina, to a friend of Nadav's who may be a peeping tom. But while Gabizon pulls off some nice fantasy touches and stages one particularly lovely, understated sex scene, he fails at fluidly integrating the disparate pieces of his cinematic puzzle, ultimately making Nadav (who seems intended to offer the film's consistent p.o.v.) a nearly peripheral character.
