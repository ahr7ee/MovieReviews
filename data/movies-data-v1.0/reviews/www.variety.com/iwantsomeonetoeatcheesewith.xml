Curb Your Enthusiasm's" Jeff Garlin has adapted his solo stage show into a fully-cast, running-gag version of "Marty." "I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With" could benefit from either more or less plot: Story of a fat comedian who still lives with his mother, eats obsessively and can't find a girlfriend never completely takes off, yet somewhat overestimates the surrounding zaniness. Still, any opportunity to witness the improvisatory skills of Sarah Silverman, Bonnie Hunt and Amy Sedaris should not be missed. Sure to amuse fans of Second City-type humor, pic won't wow but will definitely please.
Garlin's laid-back performance (in contrast to the hamminess of alter-ego Jackie Gleason, often glimpsed on a background TV) generously grants center stage to Silverman's slightly psychotic ice-cream parlor waitress, Hunt's sweetly askew schoolteacher and Sedaris' off-the-wall counselor. And lesser-known "Second City"-alumnus David Pasquesi, as Garlin's sardonic sidekick, almost steals the show. Chicago-set pic abounds in rhythm-perfect soft-shoe exchanges, as Silverman takes romance-minded Garlin on a sexual roller-coaster, or grocery counterman Dan Castellaneta gently tries, for the umpteenth time, to wean Garlin from junk food.
Camera (color, DV), Peter Biagi; editor, Steven Rasch; music, Rob Kolson. Reviewed at Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight), April 28, 2006. Running time: 80 MIN.
