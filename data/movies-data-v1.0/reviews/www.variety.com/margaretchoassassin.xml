Inspiration is running thin in comedian Margaret Cho's fourth concert film, a routine stand-up set that compares poorly to her oft-hilarious first two, continuing the preaching-to-converted mediocrity of last year's "CHO Revolution." Just serviceable as a vid-shot performance record, item looks to pass quickly through select urban hardtops before reaching more logical small screen destinations. Single-screen engagements in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City commence Sept. 2.
Having already mined her tumultuous S.F. youth and disastrous sitcom star launch, Cho seems to have run out of material -- either that or she's begun taking herself far too seriously as a spokesperson for the disgruntled left. Too much of this set is a desultory series of weak "So, what's in the news today?" jokes, predictably tapping aud outrage at "the most embarrassing President in history," etc. Largely gay following is catered to with many references to the gay marriage issue. But such hot topics stir surprisingly little comic invention, and Cho expresses her politics as crudely as the glibbest right-wing punditry. Bare-bones tech presentation and the usual bookending of she's-so-fabulous testimonials only underline the sense that this well has run dry.
