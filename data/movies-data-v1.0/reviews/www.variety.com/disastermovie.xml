Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than �Disaster Movie,� yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce from the unfortunately prolific writing-directing team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Much like their previous �Date Movie� and �Meet the Spartans,� new effort is a crazy-quilt of scattershot satirical jabs at various contempo (and a few not-so-contempo) films, TV series and overexposed celebrities. The big difference this time is, the air of desperation is even more pronounced than the lack of inspiration. Altogether worthy of its end-of-summer dump by Lionsgate, this lame trifle may generate modest homevid biz. Or not. 
Wispy plot -- basically a recycling of stale elements from �Deep Impact� and �Twister� -- serves merely as an excuse to propel cartoonish leads through episodes and encounters that feebly spoof everything from �The Dark Knight� to �10,000 B.C.,� �Enchanted� to �High School Musical.� Pic also takes aim at easy targets -- Dr. Phil, Michael Jackson, Hannah Montana -- but repeatedly misses. Amid the grimly unamusing chaos, Crista Flanagan somehow scores a few chuckles with her spot-on parody of Ellen Page�s star turn in �Juno.� Production values appear marginally more upscale than in previous Friedberg-Seltzer pics.
