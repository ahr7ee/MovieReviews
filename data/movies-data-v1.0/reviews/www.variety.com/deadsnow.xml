After hitting paydirt with the masked slasher thrills of "Cold Prey" and its sequel, Norwegian cinema mines the genre's No. 2 unstoppable killing machine via "Dead Snow." Zombie flick starts out in competent but routine fashion before the cheerfully blood-soaked later reels turn raucously tongue-in-cheek. IFC pickup is unlikely to reap more than modest theatrical rewards here, but should do well as a DVD/broadcast item in numerous territories.
After the requisite prologue showing one victim's desperate attempt to escape something in the woods, we're introduced to seven med students traveling to a friend's remote cabin. Little do they know she's already toast, having made the unfortunate decision to hike in alone. A weird older man (Bjorn Sundquist) warns them vaguely of an "evil presence" related to long-ago brutal Nazi occupiers. Turns out the latter are still lurking about, albeit undead and ready for dinner. Full-bore panic sets in around the 40-minute mark; a bit later, the pic reveals itself as a horror-action-comedy a la "Evil Dead," with amusing twists of fate and over-the-top gore. Pro package makes full use of the frozen but still picturesque countryside.
