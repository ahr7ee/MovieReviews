Suspicious minds and autumnal romance cross paths effectively in "The Other Side of the Street," a diverting, if unspectacular, Brazilian drama centered on an aging female detective. Two-time Walter Salles scripter Marcos Bernstein ("Foreign Land," "Central Station") makes his helming bow with this extended character study, maintaining a sweet atmosphere blended with intrigue and an effortless segue between crime and romance. Skewed toward older audiences, pic should have no trouble traveling to fests, but may be too uneventful for significant earnings when released worldwide in May.
Fernanda Montenegro is Regina, a 65-year-old woman who surreptitiously works as a volunteer informant for Copacabana's police force. Though she has an excellent track record busting thieves and pimps, she hits a wall when, from her "Rear Window" vantagepoint, she espies an aging judge (Raul Cortez) apparently killing his wife with a lethal injection. Stymied by the police, she continues to investigate, and in the process the judge falls for her. As the mature snoop, Montenegro is constantly engaging; but while her dry delivery enhances the perceptive nature of Bernstein's dialogue, she can't transcend the script's low-key aspirations. Technically, film is excellent.
