Americans, stay home! If the offshore terrorists, organ harvesters, torture-tourism entrepreneurs or angry ghosts don�t get you,  plant life just might. That last, latest spin on current horror conventions arrives via �The Ruins.� Ultimately less dependent on suspense or even scares than on squirm-inducing grossouts, this tale of Yank hardbodies vs. carnivorous creepers should flower briefly in hardtops, then spread like an invasive weed in ancillary.
Scenarist Scott B. Smith�s adaptation of his own novel reverses the results of his first such effort. While 1998�s Sam Raimi-helmed �A Simple Plan� elevated its source material, �Ruins� � though decently directed by feature debutant Carter Smith � only renders the same more genre-generic. Opening reel is indistinguishable from that of �Turistas,� as two post-collegiate American couples vacationing at a seaside Mexican resort mull the predictably fatal offer of a day trip to an inland spot �not in the guidebooks.� 
Invite hails from German Mathias (Joe Anderson), eager to rejoin his brother, who abandoned him for a cute female archaeologist exploring an ancient Mayan ruin. 
Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) are both game, Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) even moreso, although Jeff�s annoying-brat g.f. Amy (Jena Malone) isn�t at all intrigued by this lucky cultural-historical break. Nonetheless, the variably hung-over travelers drag themselves onto a local bus the next morning, joined by youthful Greek Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas). 
After scrambling up a hidden trail to reach the impressive temple ruins, they�re immediately surrounded by armed local Mayans who seem very riled over some offense the tourists have already committed. This immediately results in one death, and in the others� forced scurrying up the vine-covered pyramidic structure to apparent safety.
There, they discover evidence of the archaeologists� recent occupation, but the people themselves are MIA. It�s only when Amy and Stacy attempt to retrieve a cell phone from a shaft below � their discovery of the ring tone�s source yields the tale�s creepiest twist � that protags realize the insane full extent of their predicament. 
At this point, �The Ruins� abandons all hope that ye who enter here will experience any subtlety or real surprise. Instead, it leans on the �ewww� factor as characters have their bodies invaded by virulent vines and practice gruesome amateur surgery on themselves. 
Squabbling among the skin-deep characters doesn�t induce much sympathy, though thesps do their best. The novel offered a certain psychological depth; not so the film, which comes off essentially as routine, conceptually silly horror content.
Tech/design aspects are accomplished, from Darius Khondji�s widescreen lensing to the eerie soundscape inclusive of Graeme Revell�s score.
