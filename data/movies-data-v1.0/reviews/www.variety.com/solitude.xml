Low-budget indie production -- the feature debut of writers/directors Susan Kraker and Pi Ware (who married after the shoot) -- is a well-made but overly familiar entry in the manner of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." That is, a twisted family relationship is revealed to an outsider, with all the parties tearing into each other verbally. Critical support may create a cult following, but otherwise prospects for this claustrophobic drama seem dim.
Hilary (Mary Thornton) and her new friend (or, possibly, lover) Soledad (Ronne Orenna) are on their way to Flagstaff to show Soledad's art portfolio to a gallery owner. But they get waylaid in Phoenix, where Soledad finds herself the unwitting audience to -- and eventually participant in -- conflicts between Hilary and her crazy brother, Louis (Patrick Belton). The tension escalates to a supposed revelation -- the kind that's so overused it's utterly predictable. While not based on a stage play, pic feels like it is, as the characters confront each other in every possible combination. Despite good thesping, particularly from Belton, it's hard to imagine why anyone would want to spend time with this trio.
Camera (color), Marco Fargnoli; editor, Tom Sanders; music, Andrew Gross; production designers, Kraker, Ware; art director, Kraker. Reviewed at AFI Film Festival, L.A., Nov. 11, 2002. Running time: 105 MIN.
