An agreeable tone and cast make �Sherman�s Way� go down easy. Still, nothing strays far from odd-couple formulaics as an uptight Ivy Leaguer gets psychic bolts loosened by road-tripping with a genial bum (a Kevin Costner-ish role played with relish by James LeGros). Pleasant little indie, which shared Cinequest�s audience award with �The Village Barbershop,� probably lacks the distinctiveness and star power to tempt much theatrical-distrib interest, but is likeable and polished enough for exposure in smallscreen formats.
Short-leashed by his hard-driving Manhattan lawyer/politico mum and told he lacks spontaneity by his girlfriend, Sherman (Michael Shulman) rebels by bolting to the latter�s Napa Valley home for the summer. Unfortunately, he arrives just in time to witness her reunion with a hunky local b.f. Leaving in a snit, and still trying to prove he can be impulsive, he hitches a ride with the next car that goes by. It happens to be a vintage cherry-red convertible driven -- and possibly stolen -- by ex-Olympic skier Palmer (LeGros), Sherman�s ne�er-do-well opposite. Amiable, well-crafted if unoriginal comedy features Enrico Colantoni as Palmer�s laid-back bud and Brooke Nevin as Sherman�s new quirky-girl romantic interest.
Camera (color, 16mm-to-HD), Joaquin Sedillo; editor, Christopher Gay; music, David Michael Frank; production designer, Laurent Turlure. Reviewed at Cinequest Film Festival (New Visions), San Jose, Feb. 29, 2008. Running time: 98 MIN.
