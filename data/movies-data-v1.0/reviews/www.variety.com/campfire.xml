Despite being fueled by romantic yearnings and sexual assault, Israeli family drama "Campfire" fails to spark. Pic juggles several storylines that include the personal and political, but is unable to get beyond soap-opera shtick. Characters behave erratically -- calm when things are at crisis and insane when little is at stake. Jewish-themed fests may mull this one, but only if they're desperate for product.

Set in 1981, film begins with widowed Rachael (Michaela Eshet) emerging from a year of mourning. A mother of two, she's ready to be romanced once more, but is less prepared for the sexual awakenings of her teenage daughters, the rebellious Esty (Maya Maron) and the younger, sweet but sexually curious Tami (Hani Furstenburg). Latter finds herself in hot water while attending an overnight bonfire celebration with her Zionist youth group. Pic is ambiguous about whether Tami is actually raped or just molested but, regardless, gossip blazes through the community. Script grinds-on mechanically and ends clunkily. Performances are amiable but wooden, though scenes between Rachael and her 50-year-old virgin beau, Yossi (Moshe Ivgy), are more touching. Lensing is flat; other credits good.
Camera (color, 35mm), Ofer Inov; editor, Einat Glaser Zarhin; music, Ofer Shalchim; art director, Miguel Merkin; costume designer, Laura Sheim. Reviewed at Berlin Film Festival (Forum), Feb. 9, 2004. Running time: 96 MIN.
