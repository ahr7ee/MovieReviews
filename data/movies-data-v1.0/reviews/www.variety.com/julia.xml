Admittedly inspired by John Cassavetes� �Gloria� and its gritty central perf by Gena Rowlands as a tough-talking dame on the run with a little kid, the miscalculated and overlong �Julia� proves a startling misfire for �The Dreamlife of Angels� writer-helmer Erick Zonca and dependably fearless actress Tilda Swinton. Stateside chances are negligible for this English-language, Los Angeles-set pic (set to open in France on March 12) that uncomfortably welds an arthouse sensibility to genre tropes.
A swaggering floozy with a monumental drinking problem, 40-ish Julia Harris (Swinton) staggers from one booze-fueled hookup to the next. When she�s fired from her job, her ex-b.f. Mitch (Saul Rubinek) pleads with her to slow down and attend AA meetings.
When a ditzy fellow attendee, Elena (Kate del Castillo), begs Julia to help kidnap her son Tom (Aidan Gould), whom Elena is not allowed to see, it�s a measure of Julia�s sheer desperation that she goes along with the plan -- or what passes for a plan. Julia ends up with Elena�s boy stuffed in her trunk, engineering inept ransom negotiations with the boy�s never-seen industrialist grandfather and eluding some Mexican lowlifes when she literally crashes her car across the border to Tijuana.
Everything feels emotionally skewed in Zonca�s English-language debut. Pic�s first half-hour yields precious little flavor of the Los Angeles milieu (shifted from Cassavetes� beloved New York); scenes awkwardly improvised at an emotional fever pitch go on far too long; and sequences in which the boy is held at gunpoint or hogtied to motel-room water pipes are uncomfortably exploitative. 
Helmer made his rep as an eloquent portrayer of marginalized French young people caught up in the tumult of day-to-day existence, and vestiges of that remain here. Yet pic is defeated by a tin ear for the kind of slangy, musical English dialogue that made Cassavetes� films what they are. Last reels devolve into a series of screaming matches between Julia and the absurdly exaggerated Mexican toughs.
As she seems to do with each successive role, Swinton becomes the character with a fierce alchemy. Unfortunately, by the time Julia is actually meant to care for the boy, the redemption feels more convenient than emotionally earned. Pic�s most authentic perf is turned in by German-born Canadian mainstay Rubinek, whose monologue about striking his child while drunk during a long-ago marriage marks a rare moment when pic is firing on all cylinders. 
Tech credits are pro, led by Yorick Le Saux�s crisp widescreen lensing.
