�The Love Guru� is so relentlessly juvenile as to merit a new twist on the PG-13 rating -- one that strongly cautions not only those under 13 but anyone much above it, too. Even so, producer/co-writer/star Mike Myers partially wears down resistance by simply pummeling the audience with bathroom jokes, sixth-grade puns and silly songs, and clocking in under 90 minutes, the movie avoids this summer�s comedic mini-trend of overstaying its welcome. Opening opposite �Get Smart� isn�t ideal, but coupled with lingering affection for the �Austin Powers� series, this might just be dumb enough to at least hold its own.
Myers developed the character of Guru Pitka via a sort-of workshop process of New York stage appearances, and for the most part, this spoof of self-help spiritualism feels like a �Saturday Night Live� bit fluffed and stretched to theatrical length.  Many of the jokes bring to mind Three Stooges-type farce (Ben Kingsley�s master guru is named -- now sound this out -- Tugginmypudha), including a seemingly endless array of self-improvement acronyms like Be Loving &amp; Open With My Emotions -- all trademarked, of course.
Although a renowned guru, Pitka suffers from an inferiority complex regarding his childhood pal Deepak Chopra, and yearns to equal Chopra�s level of fame by winning an appearance on �The Oprah Winfrey Show.� (Make what you will of the fact that while Chopra makes a cameo appearance, the pic has to settle for �Oprah� footage and a Winfrey voice impersonator.)
Pitka�s potential ticket to fame comes from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Jane (Jessica Alba), who is struggling with a star player (Romany Malco) emotionally wounded by a bad marital rift. Hoping to salvage the team�s chances of winning the Stanley Cup Finals, she retains Pitka to cure the case of the yips the player�s developed -- brought about, seemingly, by his wife�s rebound relationship with the enormously endowed Jacques �Le Coq� Grande (Justin Timberlake).
 The porous plot, actually, is all secondary to the shtick, and working completely unfettered by first-time director Marco Schnabel, Myers cheerfully unleashes a steady barrage of hit-and-mostly-miss gags that range from Bollywood numbers (pretty funny) to repeated use of �Mariska Hargitay� (yes, the name of the �Law &amp; Order� star) as a felicitous greeting to elephant erotica (not that funny for anybody who�s ever been to the zoo). With �Powers� � Mini-Me, Verne Troyer, as the Leafs� hockey coach, there�s also a near-limitless supply of runt, elf and Hobbit jokes.
Beyond Myers, pic pretty much squanders its supporting cast -- though Timberlake does steal a few moments with his awful Canadian accent -- which includes Comedy Central�s Stephen Colbert as a drug-addled announcer and �The Daily Show�s� John Oliver as Pitka�s agent. As for Alba, she has even less to do here, if that�s possible, than in �Good Luck Chuck,� which might warrant some further thought about playing the object of desire in screwball comedies.
Rambunctiousness by itself is hardly a virtue, but Myers so unabashedly embraces the lowest rungs of comedic DNA that whether one succumbs to it or not, at least there�s no time to be wasted arguing about subtext. Sitting through �The Love Guru� doesn�t provide any grand insights about self-actualization, but if watching someone get sloshed with urine sounds like a knee-slapper, then Mike Myers is determined to make movies for you.
