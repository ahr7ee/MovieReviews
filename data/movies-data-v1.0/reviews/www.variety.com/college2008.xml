Hardly superbad, but sorta OK, "College" solves for X in an equation with young TV actors plus fake IDs, bare skin and bodily fluids. Summer's final weekend may draw underagers to pic's familiarly tapped keg, wherein a road trip brings three geeky, horny high school boys to a college campus for American pie, frathouse hazing and the nerds' revenge, in that order. Begrudging chuckles come via ultra-crude gags, none yuckier than that of the "pre-frosh" trio doing unsanitary body shots off a furry jock called Bearcat.
Sporting sideburns, Nickelodeon alum Drake Bell earns pic's few mellow moments as a cutie photographer who traipses from one barely delineated g.f. (Alona Tal) to another (Haley Bennett). Andrew Caldwell and former "American Idol" contestant Kevin Covais steal one or two scenes apiece as, respectively, the tubby slob who scarfs cereal straight from the box and the four-eyed wimp whose physical education is limited to lifting physics textbooks. Well-paced pic, shot in New Orleans, looks intermittently dark and splotchy. Music is embarrassingly out of date; opening credits are splayed on jerseys, cig-strewn concrete, a cell phone and, yes, pre-frosh flesh.
