Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it�s saying something that �Superhero Movie� provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of the gags that just lie there aren�t actively painful. This comicbook actioner sendup should do solid if unspectacular biz.
Primary model/target here is the first �Spider-Man� movie.  High school dweeb Rick Riker (Drake Bell, of Nickelodeon�s �Drake &amp; Josh�) has lived with dear Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross) and Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielsen) since his parents died.  He�s in love with the girl next door, Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), but she barely knows he exists and is dating jerk jock Lance (Ryan Hansen). 
On a school field trip to a local manufacturer, Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals, Rick is accidentally spritzed with a powerful artificial pheromone, which attracts unwelcome amorous attention from the lab�s entire range of genetically modified animals. 
One of them is a dragonfly that bites Rick, who, once he�s regained consciousness, seems to have gained superpowers -- including, natch, the ability to climb up walls with his super-grip. (Though that grip, of course, also leads to some embarrassing hands-on-the-wrong-thing experiences.)
Rick begins fighting crime across Empire City as the mysterious costumed Dragonfly. Meanwhile, jock Lance�s uncle and Amalgamated CEO Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald), who is terminally ill but seeks immortality, plans a mass murder coinciding with the city�s hosting of the World Humanity Awards. 
Climax at latter event allows for cameo appearances by an ersatz Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and others, following earlier ones by a foul voice-boxed Stephen Hawking (Robert Joy) and berserk Tom Cruise (Miles Fisher, who�s so good maybe the sequel should be �Tom Cruise Movie�).
Writer-helmer Craig Mazin --whose prior directorial feature was another superhero spoof, �The Specials� (2000), and who, like several others here, is a vet of the �Scary Movie� franchise -- keeps things slick and brisk. Very brisk, in fact: Without lengthy end credits that break for inclusion of numerous deleted gags (rather than bloopers), �Superhero Movie� would barely nudge past 70 minutes. Still, 70 minutes of good if unmemorable fun sure beats 80 or 90 minutes of excruciating parodies for dummies, a la �Date Movie� and �Epic Movie.�
While �Superhero Movie� has its share of rote slapstick and scatological jokes (though one urination bit is actually a highlight), Mazin does think beyond the midget-throwing, accidental-dude-kissing, other-movie-referencing box.
Perfs are solid if seldom inspired. Tracy Morgan provides one of the better turns (as Patrick Stewart�s equivalent) in a sequence that digresses into �X-Men� territory. Pamela Anderson gets good billing for just one scene; others making cameo appearances include Charlene Tilton, Robert Hays, Lil� Kim, Craig Bierko and Regina Hall.
Tech package is smooth, with some f/x deliberately on the cheesy side.
