The joys of farce are fumbled in "April's Shower," star-director-writer Trish Doolan's arch and undernourished comedy about a bridal shower turned on its head by the bride's lesbian past. The antique premise (certainly as compared with the hip, urban cultural profile exhibited in the movie) has April (Maria Cina) willing to forsake her lesbian identity to marry nice Pauly (Randall Batinkoff) and thereby please her mom (Molly Cheek). But she insists on having her ex-lover Alex (Doolan) serve as maid-of-honor and host. Crowd-pleaser at undemanding gay-lesbian fests may receive a few bouquets from female-skewed cablers.
So much time is spent justifying the pic's set-up that the comedy never works up steam. As the guests pile into Alex's home, havoc is unleashed as Alex has a hissy fit and April's mom learns her daughter's true desires. Any genuine emotions get smothered in inept humor, typified by one confirmed lesbian character suddenly lip-locking with a stud delivering pizza. Pic is plagued by messy staging of ensemble scenes and relentlessly gauzy lensing.
