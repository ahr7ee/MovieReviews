Known in the WWE ring as the �Dr. of Thuganomics,� John Cena lacks even a bachelor of arts, to judge from his dropkick of a perf in �12 Rounds.� Ludicrous pic casts Cena as a New Orleans cop whose fiancee is held hostage by an arms dealer with a grudge. Put through the titular paces, Cena�s officer unsurprisingly prevails, while the viewer, even from a seated position, deserves a championship belt for surviving this overlong actioner. The film was withheld from critics before its wide opening, which should result in so-so B.O. for a weekend until the pic gets pinned.
Heavy on stunts but light on plausibility, humor, surprise, visual ingenuity or psychological depth helmer Renny Harlin�s latest pic opens with cop Danny Fisher (Cena) hooking big catch Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen) just after the crook�s jewel-loving g.f. has fallen victim to the perils of a high-speed chase. Suffering from grief, or perhaps just humiliation, the psychotic Jackson busts out of prison and proceeds to set up a dozen elaborate punishments for the cop -- the first two of which have our hero losing his house and Molly (Ashley Scott), the love of his life.
One of the villain�s taunts challenges Fisher to sprint or motor through New Orleans streets, including those in the city�s hurricane-battered Ninth Ward. Notwithstanding its support of the Big Easy�s economy, �12 Rounds� fully wears out its welcome during round five, which requires the cop to steer a fire truck at Indy 500 speed, causing predictably massive property damage and no acceleration of the viewer�s pulse.
Oddly, only the final round, set aboard a medical helicopter, makes use of the wrestler�s one discernible talent, even if the setting doesn�t provide sufficient room for power-slamming.
Bulky Cena does a lot of running here, although Harlin breaks the heavier sweat by straining to keep pace with Paul Greengrass� �Bourne� pics. Jittery editing -- combined with the helmer�s shaky-cam images, many seen through computer screens or other extraneous frames -- makes the movie very hard to watch, much less appreciate. Only a scene wherein Fisher scrambles to stop a brakeless streetcar raises one�s heart rate.
�The Marine,� Cena�s bigscreen debut, also had his character suffering from a sweetheart�s abduction, although typecasting should be the least of the actor�s worries. To be fair, Cena performs as capably as any other cast member here save for George, the pug that plays Fisher�s brilliant dog, Shortie.
