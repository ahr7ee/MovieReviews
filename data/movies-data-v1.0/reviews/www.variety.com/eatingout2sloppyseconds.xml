The horny gay and straight young folks from "Eating Out" continue to crack wise and sniff out partners in "Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds" -- and the filmmaking continues to be just as sloppy. Sequel is no more than a cheapo campy goof, but this edition does contain a higher quota of laugh lines and an unsubtle message that efforts to make gay youth "go straight" is destined to fail. Original's popularity in vid seems certain to extend to this follow-up, now having a modest spin around gay and lesbian fests.
Dumped by b.f. Marc (Brett Chukerman), Kyle (Jim Verraros, reprising his role from the previous pic) is turned on by the new male model in his art class, Troy (Marco Dapper). Troy claims to be hetero, but Kyle and gal pals Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands) and slutty Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan) aren't so sure. To test Troy's leanings, Kyle takes him to a "going straight" session that provides the pic with broad satirical targets. Gay cinema favorites such as Mink Stole add to the party atmosphere, and thesps have fun even if they confuse reciting lines with acting.
