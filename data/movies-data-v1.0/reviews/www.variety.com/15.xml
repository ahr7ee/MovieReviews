"15" is Asian Kid Rebels 101. So predictable it could almost be a parody of the genre -- though that would require a sense of humor above and beyond the self-reflexive comedy on display here -- film follows five disaffected teens bumming around in the gritty underbelly of, uh, Singapore. First feature by young shortsmaker Royston Tan is pure fest fare and will appeal to like-minded auds with the leisure to celebrate designer "rebellion."
Collage-style pic, full of on-screen graphics (in Chinese) and the whole manual of film school trickery, follows the fatuous five (purportedly played by real street kids) as they complain about not being understood by their parents and turn to what passes in Singapore for anti-social acts. This involves lounging around smoking joints, popping pills, singing nonsense rap songs, dreaming in cliches about their future and playing at homoeroticism. When one of them says he wants to commit suicide and let all of Singapore know about it, he can't even find a suitable building to jump off. Yup, it's that kind of film. Tech credits are fine within the prescribed limits.
