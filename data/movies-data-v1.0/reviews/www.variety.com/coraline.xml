Eerily inhabiting the netherworld where a young girl�s wildest dreams become her cruelest nightmares, �Coraline� is a dark delight. Although it coarsens some of the details in Neil Gaiman�s popular 2002 children�s horror novel, this eccentric and deliriously inventive fantasy finds stop-motion auteur Henry Selick scaling new heights of ghoulish whimsy, buoyed by a haunting score that works its own macabre magic. Probably too frightening for very small tots, the PG-rated Focus Features toon deserves to be seen in all its bigscreen 3-D glory, but should also achieve family-favorite status on homevid.
�Coraline� may benefit from the added synergy of an upcoming Off Broadway musical (slated for a May 6 world premiere) and a videogame (released Jan. 27) featuring voicework by three of the film�s thesps: Dakota Fanning, Keith David and Robert Bailey Jr. The captivatingly creepy yarn also has inspired an Italian short film, an Irish puppet show, a Swedish play and a P. Craig Russell graphic novel -- not bad for a book that sprung from a series of bedtime stories Gaiman told his daughters in the 1990s.
Like the novel, the film functions as a crafty cautionary tale on the perils of getting what you want, whether it�s a pair of gloves or a new family. Yet the dazzling colors and unhinged imagination of Selick�s visual palette also have the effect of rendering �Coraline�s� fantasy world that much more eye-ticklingly and dangerously seductive.
Small but spunky, with blue hair and stick-like limbs, Coraline Jones (engagingly voiced by Fanning) is an only child who feels neglected by her garden-catalog-writing parents (Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman). The three have just moved into a ramshackle old boarding house whose other tenants include two faded actresses, Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French), and a Russian acrobat (Ian McShane) who has his own rodent circus.
Where Gaiman tossed off these peculiar supporting characters with deadpan drollery, the pic somewhat ill-advisedly turns them into colorful, almost Busby Berkeley-esque sideshow attractions that are simultaneously dazzling and wearying. Selick�s script also saddles Coraline with a goth-nerd sidekick, Wybie (Bailey), a figure of eventual dramatic importance but questionable comic value.
The film is on surer footing once Coraline unlocks a mysterious door in the wall and finds herself in a parallel dimension that looks an awful lot like home, emphasis on the awful. This haunted house is impeccably maintained by Coraline�s �other mother,� a dead ringer for her real mother, only she�s cheery and attentive and probably smells like cookies -- oh, and she has black buttons where her eyes should be. Clearly, something�s not quite right here. And when the other mother tells Coraline she must live there forever and have buttons sewn into her own eyes (�Soon, you�ll see things our
 way�), the chill is unmistakable.
Coraline�s other mother likes to play games and create twisted facsimiles of real-world people and places; in that respect, she and Selick have a lot in common. While this is Selick�s first toon not produced by Tim Burton (after �The Nightmare Before Christmas� and �James and the Giant Peach�), it�s very much in keeping with that filmmaker�s darkly funny spirit; even the production design bears shades of Burton�s �Beetlejuice.� The use of stop-motion, as opposed to CG or hand-drawn 2-D animation, is inspired; with its slightly stilted, frame-by-frame movements and tactile, stylized puppets, the film never lets one forget that it�s an imperfectly hand-crafted marvel -- a world the other mother herself might have stitched together.
As Coraline and a helpful cat (David) engage their enemy in a battle of wits, the film keeps bursting its stylistic boundaries: A scene set at the outer reaches of this make-believe world harks back to the Looney Tunes classic �Duck Amuck,� and a later sequence brilliantly visualizes the idea of Coraline as a fly trapped in her captor�s web. As a visual experience, �Coraline� is enriched immeasurably by its sophisticated 3-D engine, which is after subtler, more immersive effects -- sweeping camera movements, delineation of foreground and background -- than the mere gimmick of having objects pop out from the screen.
Riffing on her �Desperate Housewives� role with a devious sense of fun, Hatcher (with the help of some nifty character morphing by the pic�s animators) makes the other mother a villain worthy of the many evil stepmoms that have preceded her. But the film�s most indelible asset is French composer Bruno Coulais� score, a feverish singsong concoction that evokes a girl�s everyday boredom as well as the demons lurking just beyond the limits of her imagination.
