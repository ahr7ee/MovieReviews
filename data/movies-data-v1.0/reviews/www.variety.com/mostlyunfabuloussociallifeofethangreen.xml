"The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green" is a frothy lark with a decided sense of the outrageous, sincere affection for its characters and their romantic plights. Based on the comicstrip by Eric Orner, pic may be so aggressively gay as to limit its appeal even among intended auds. Distribs' interest will depend on open-mindedness all around. 
"Ethan" finds its title character in love again, this time with Kyle, a former big-league ballplayer who's come out of the closet in a book and has pretty much swept Ethan off his feet. Meanwhile, his ex-boyfriend, Leo, is trying to sell the house Ethan lives in, so in an effort not to become homeless, Ethan enlists the help of Punch (Dean Shelton), an impish 19-year-old sex machine, and pile of human wreckage Sunny Deal (Rebecca Lowman), a real estate agent, to nix the house sale. 
It's a crackpot of a soap opera, ornamented by a great deal of sexual humor, sexual innuendo and sex. Lead Daniel Letterle (of "Camp") is a charmingly boyish actor, and the other featured players -- particularly veteran actress Meredith Baxter as Ethan's gay-wedding-planner mother -- are excellent.
"Ethan Green" has a bright, cheerful palette and a cast that's just about as colorful. It also has a very traditionalist sort of denouement, which may seem incongruous for such an out-there, comedy -- but is pretty predictable when the subject is romance.
