�Music Within,� the decidedly �70s-flavored story of Richard Pimentel, the motivational speaker and writer who helped pass the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, convincingly delivers the message that disabilities are everyone�s concern. Helmed by Steve Sawalich, this real-life dramedy is anchored by Michael Sheen�s captivating performance as the severely handicapped, profoundly acerbic Art Honeyman. Commercial response should be modest but passionate. 
A bit soft around the edges -- Ron Livingston as Pimentel is a sympathetic but puppyish leading man -- the picture wastes no time making its point: Richard is more or less victimized at birth by what can be described as betrayal by the human body and mind: His mother (Rebecca De Mornay) has suffered seven miscarriages by the time he�s born, and the effect is to send her into a disturbed mental state that dictates the course of Richard�s childhood. 
As a young man, Richard discovers a talent for public speaking, but when he auditions for �College Bowl� founder Dr. Ben Padrow (an imperious Hector Elizondo), he�s told in no uncertain terms that he needs to have a life before he can convince others of his point of view. Richard thinks he�s had a life. But he joins the Army, goes to Vietnam and, during a shelling of his platoon, loses his hearing.  
Accompanied by some very deliberately programmed and too obvious period music -- including the unwelcome bleatings of Three Dog Night, America and the Youngbloods -- Richard returns to college, where he meets Art (Sheen), a wheelchair-bound, beret-wearing verbal bomb-thrower, who is wracked by cerebral palsy but harbors a caustic wit and a hilarious gift for obscenity. Ironically, Richard�s deafness allows to him understand Art, so a social movement of two is born, as they get kicked out of restaurants, endure the contemptuous glances of passersby and are generally ostracized by a public horrified or disgusted by Art�s writhing incoherence.
�Music Within� is less than subtle about the way people were treated before and after the Disabilities Act, and depending on one�s tolerance for overstatement, the film might tread a bit heavily on the moral outrage. But Sheen (best known for playing Tony Blair in �The Queen� and David Frost in �Frost/Nixon�) is remarkable -- one of the film�s stratagems is that Art is made understandable through Richard�s eyes and damaged ears, but a garble otherwise. So Sheen is really required to give two technically difficult performances. He�s utterly convincing, and the humanity he brings to the part only helps drive home the film�s social issues.
Script by Brett McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen and Kelly Kennemer is good, but just sort of cobbles together a romantic subplot, between Richard and beautiful free-love advocate Christine (Melissa George), who fail to find a meeting ground for their mutual affection. In a smaller but essential role, Yul Vazquez turns Mike Stoltz, one of Richard�s fellow vets, into an intemperate alcoholic firebrand. After Sheen, Vasquez is the best thing in the film. 
Production values are adequate, but �Music Within� was always a film that was going to rely on heart rather than craft.
