    Gender equity is a reality rather than an abstract goal, it appears, in the Oaxaca, Mexico city of Juchitan --- a circumstance novel enough to have spurred somewhat sensationalized accounts of a wild-women's "matriarchy" in publications from upscale Elle to supermarket tabloids. The humbler yet still unusual actuality gets an admiring perusal in "Blossoms of Fire." U.S. docu is engaging tube fare, with potential for limited theatrical exposure.
    Though hardly the party-hearty, macho-female enclave it's sometimes painted as, midsize Juchitan (pop. 100,000) has stayed true to its indigenous Zampatec roots in that customary gender-biased roles don't apply: Women run the produce markets and other small industries, generally handle family finances, and take full part in region's stubbornly anti-PRI political activism. Homosexuality and transgender persons enjoy rare, respectful tolerance. Looks at area's history, distinctive art and the cultural threat of globalization fill out episodic progress. Pic's only liability is its relentlessly upbeat tenor (heightened by rather gushy narration) --- one doubts that society's usual ills are as wholly absent from Juchitan as suggested here. Results at times seem as much p.c. travelogue as serious docu inquiry. Bright lensing takes its cue from populace's brilliantly colored, hand-crafted attire; other tech aspects are well-handled.
