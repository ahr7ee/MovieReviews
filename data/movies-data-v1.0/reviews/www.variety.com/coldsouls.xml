An amusing slice of existential whimsy with an Eastern European bent, �Cold Souls� posits a world in which humans can have their souls extracted and implanted in each others� bodies. It�s the sort of idea one can imagine Charlie Kaufman running wild with, but Sophie Barthes' writing-helming debut is too well-behaved and conventional, stylistically and metaphysically, to achieve the desired levels of creative lunacy. Marketing will need to emphasize the pic�s goofy premise and Paul Giamatti�s enjoyable performance to overcome cool but respectful critical response.
As �Being John Malkovich� allowed Malkovich to spoof himself, so �Cold Souls� hands its lead thesp a similar opportunity, albeit with less side-splitting results. Giamatti plays Paul Giamatti, a New York actor who�s preparing for the title role in Chekhov�s �Uncle Vanya� and finding it increasingly difficult to separate himself from the character.
A New Yorker magazine piece sends the emotionally exhausted thesp into the offices of Dr. Flintstein (David Strathairn), who specializes in �soul storage� -- the science of temporarily removing up to 95% of a person�s soul and all the emotional burdens that accompany it. Wary but desperate, Paul agrees to the operation and is pushed into a giant contraption that resembles a radiotherapy machine. His soul (which looks suspiciously like a garbanzo bean) is bottled for safekeeping, and he leaves a new man.
Trouble is, the new man can�t act, and Paul soon returns to Dr. Flintstein, who obligingly loans him the soul of a Russian poet. Soon Paul is thriving in �Uncle Vanya,� but offstage, the borrowed soul starts making itself felt in the form of eerie dreams, and Paul�s wife (an underused Emily Watson) feels alienated from a man who is clearly not entirely her husband.
A bizarrely integrated subplot follows striking Russian blonde Nina (Dina Korzun), who works as a mule for her homeland�s black-market soul trade. Script contorts itself rather implausibly (even for a movie where implausibility is the rule) as it sends Paul and Dina on a madcap mission to Russia to retrieve his lost soul.
All this nonsense is tossed off with a droll matter-of-factness, and the pic generates some comic mileage from Giamatti�s incredulous, is-everyone-insane-but-me reaction shots, particularly in the early consultation scenes with Strathairn�s deadpan doc.
But aside from marveling at its own wacky (if finally somewhat thin) conceit and making a couple jokes at Giamatti�s expense, the pic never mines any deeper levels of comedy; nor does it deliver that exhilarating Kaufman-esque sensation of getting lost in its own heady conundrums. Warmer than its title would suggest, �Cold Souls� is finally less a philosophical fantasia than a tale of empathy and human connection, beautifully summed up in its lyrical closing shot.
Giamatti has excelled at playing insecure malcontents before (�Sideways�); he�s more open and relaxed here, but just as winning. Korzun prevails over a thinly written role that doesn�t really gel until the third act.
While the pic might have benefited from a more visually offbeat approach, Andrij Parekh�s cool, wintry lensing nicely approximates the tale�s emotional register.
