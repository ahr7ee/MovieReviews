The title makes it sound like a Western, but �The Other End of the Line� is more of an Eastern-Western, offering a pretty savvy take on the romantic possibilities of subcontinental telemarketing. Girl calls boy, girl meets boy, boy loses girl and girl�s parents come from Mumbai to San Francisco to do a whole lot of handwringing in this frothy comedy from helmer James Dodson, a winning Stateside debut for beautiful Indian actress Shriya Saran. Despite its charming cast, this MGM release managed to dial up just $57,000 from 91 engagements for a per-location average of $626. 
Most Americans react to Indian telemarketers the way they react to a jury summons, but they seldom get anyone as professional or as winning as Priya Sethi (Saran). Priya is the most eager-beaverish at Citi One Bank Card�s Bangalore call center, the employee with the best American accent, the most nuanced knowledge of American fast food, the one who can distinguish Sarah Jessica Parker from Mary-Louise Parker. Thus, she�s also the best at convincing Americans on the phone that she isn�t an Indian woman, but rather Jennifer David of San Francisco.
Some of scripter Tracey Jackson�s best material is in the call-center scenes, where often beleaguered, well-mannered Indians are abused daily over the phone. (�Can I get out of New Jersey?� one worker pleads. �Everyone�s swearing at me.� No, her supervisor says: �Everyone starts in New Jersey.�) Investigating a case of identity theft, Priya ends up calling good-looking Bay Area ad man Granger Woodruff (Jesse Metcalf) so often that they develop a phone relationship, which leads to expectations on both ends. The problem: Priya is being pushed into an arranged marriage and, unbeknownst to Granger, doesn�t live in San Francisco.
But that�s where they end up meeting, via a series of contrivances that should be tiresome but end up being tolerable, mostly thanks to Saran. Her Priya is in fact a little too hip for a supposedly obedient Mumbai girl -- hipper than Granger, even. He and his pal and partner, Charlie (Austin Basis), are trying haplessly to develop a campaign for a chain of hotels whose owner, Kit Hawksin, as played by Larry Miller, is the other reason to see this movie. The comedian isn�t in nearly as many movies as he should be, and his timing here is hilariously deft. Where much of �The Other End of the Line� has to adhere to a daffy sweetness, Miller takes Jackson�s material into a different realm entirely.
That�s a good thing, because the rest of the film shoplifts from any number of movie romances, including �Pretty Woman,� �Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House� and, most shamelessly, �An Officer and a Gentleman.� But as cross-cultural bridge-builders go, pic is smart, funny and sweet enough to make you reassess your attitude next time you get reach tech support in New Delhi.
