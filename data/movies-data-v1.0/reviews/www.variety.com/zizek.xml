A little bit of Slovene philosopher Slavoj Zizek goes a long way. In the verbose profile docu "Zizek!" there's a lot of esoteric, eccentric theories, and little context within his globetrotting life. While the barrage of ideas may be off-putting for the masses, U.S. distrib Zeitgeist could score quick, modest coin at upscale venues prior to more appropriate tube sales and cult homevid.
Subject is a bearded, sweating, antisocial, eminently quotable bear of a man who throws out ideas in a heavily accented lisp. Zizek's work fuses Marxism and the thinking of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-1981), who put a post-structuralist spin on Freud. Further twists are his encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture and extreme pronouncements: "My big worry," he frets, "is not to be ignored, but accepted." Zizek speaks to a rapt Buenos Aires crowd, plays cautiously with his "narcissistically amused" son and talks. And talks. Tech credits are average, highlighted by Molly Schwartz's stylish animated interstitials. Vancouver fest title "Slavoj Zizek: The Reality of the Virtual" is a different film on the same subject. November 16 New York bow will be on Beta SP, with subsequent 35mm blowup possible.
Camera (color, DigiBeta SP), Martina Radwan, Jesse Epstein; editor, Laura Hanna; music, Jeremy Barnes. Reviewed at Toronto Film Festival (Real to Reel), Sept. 10, 2005. English, Slovene dialogue. Running time: 69 MIN.
