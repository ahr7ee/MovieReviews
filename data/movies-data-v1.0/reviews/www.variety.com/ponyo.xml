Hayao Miyazaki�s latest animated epic, �Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,� unfolds with a magic limpidity, teeming with imaginative transports that owe nothing to CGI. Effortlessly shuttling between sea, land and sky, this �Little Mermaid�-ish tale dives deep into the collective unconscious of Japan�s island culture, imagining a transparency between natural elements that promises salvation and apocalypse in equal measure. Though targeted at tots, �Ponyo� may appeal most to jaded adults thirsty for wondrous beauty and unpackaged innocence. Pic is the first local production since Miyazaki�s �Howl�s Moving Castle� (2004) to pass ¥10 billion ($93.2 million) at home.
Widely perceived as a positive manifestation of the �second childhood� of its 67-year-old visionary director, pic marks a stylistic U-turn from the rendered literalism of the fantasy components in �Howl�s Moving Castle.� Pic frequently partakes of simpler, sparer setups, and more distilled, abstract compositions, with foreshortened perspectives and whimsically freewheeling character designs that imply the direct influence of children�s drawing.
Miyazaki�s underwater specimens decidedly defy scientific categorization. Perky Ponyo (voiced by Yuria Nara), a fish with a little face and red dress, lives beneath the sea with her red-haired, ecologically anxious father and hundreds of much tinier, red-dressed sisters. Curious about the surface world, she hitches a ride atop one of many floating jellyfish (using a smaller, more diaphanous jellyfish as a windshield dome).
Swept up by a dredging net, along with the detritus of civilization (everything from bathtubs to oil sludge), Ponyo is rescued by 5-year-old Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), who resides on a cliff above the ocean and promises to protect her always.
Eventually, Ponyo�s sorcerer father manages to recapture his wayward offspring. But Ponyo, both a willful child and an ungovernable force of nature, soon escapes again, in the process upsetting the Earth�s ecological balance.
Accidentally unleashing her father�s magic elixir, Ponyo triggers a tour de force orchestration of swirling elements that transform her wee helpful little sisters into huge fish that overrun the sea in a vast tsunami. Ponyo triumphantly rises atop the mounting waves to near-Wagnerian strains, oblivious to the total devastation she has wrought.
If Sosuke serves as the template for the perfect child (with his boat-captain father often away and his dashingly imagined daredevil mother given to impulse, he assumes responsibility for everyone), Ponyo is definitely a handful. Miyazaki has crafted no demure little mermaid, and no soft dissolves accompany her awkward transitions to human form: The legs she first sprouts are chicken-like appendages, and her occasional headlong dives involve swift regressions to amoeba-like formlessness. 
Miyazaki has inadvertently dished up yet another challenge to the universe of hand-drawn toons: Even more so than his previous outings, the film confounds traditional notions of anthropomorphism, dwelling especially on the transformative properties of water.
Far more upbeat than much of Miyazaki�s oeuvre, limned in bright pastel colors where even destruction is golden, �Ponyo� possesses an almost demonic childish energy and a delight in form stronger than reason or narrative. Even Armageddon, as loosed by Ponyo and imagined by Miyazaki, is a wondrous place where half-armored prehistoric fish glide alongside their more evolved cousins, submerged trees form mysterious swamplands and a �ship graveyard� of foundering vessels appears in the distance, like a fairyland of lights stretched out upon the water.
Disney will release the film Aug. 14 in an English-dubbed version under the title �Ponyo.�
