The thawing of a snow-bound young man's aimless existence is the heavily applied metaphor in "Aurora Borealis." Alternately breezy and pro-found, pic hits enough emo-tional chords to connect with auds, which will be charmed by a newly mature Joshua Jackson, a deeply aged Donald Suther-land and a friskily romantic Juliette Lewis. This reps a solid item for mid-level fests and will offer warmer returns in ancil-lary than in cool theatrical venues.
Resistant toward any real job, 25-year-old Minneapolis native Duncan (Jackson) resembles a Kevin Smith character shuffling through life, demanding little of himself and expecting little in return. His slackerdom is under-lined by occasional clashes with corporate-driven bro Jacob (Ste-ven Pasquale).
Director James Burke, with writer Brent Boyd, admirably retreat from judging their charac-ters, an attitude that's especially helpful in Duncan's case. The sudden need to help his ill grand-father Ronald (Sutherland) -- who's more than grandmother Ruth (Louise Fletcher) can handle most of the time -- serves the rather elementary dramatic pur-pose of forcing Duncan to behave like an adult.
With multiple afflictions, Ronald is every elderly aud member's worst nightmare. Duncan makes the giant step (for him) of landing a handyman's job in his grandpar-ent's building so he can be close to them. Too obviously entering as Duncan's future love interest, home nurse Kate (Lewis) is hired as a therapist for Ronald and,  meeting Duncan in his most empa-thetic mode, it's charm at first sight.
Pic goes through the rather predictable hoops until  the pair discovers their rather stark dif-ferences. Latter element is over-played with dialogue insistently noting that while Duncan has never lived anywhere beyond Minneapolis' city limits, Kate hardly stays in one city long enough to get a b.f.
Easing viewers over the lumpy mid-section and through the predictable third act is the un-abashed good nature of Jackson and Lewis, both of whom have rarely been so enjoyably charis-matic. Going against his WB-engendered cocky persona, Jack-son stresses Duncan's vulnerabili-ties thereby centering the film emotionally. Lewis winningly plays it straight.
Sutherland may ham it up a tad as an old codger with shaky hands, but he does it with theatrical flair that works to his sad character's advantage. Fletcher is a rather marginal participant amidst the good thesping.
Even compared to the Coen Brothers, Minnesota has rarely felt as Arctic as it does here, all the more impressive for the mas-sive amounts of artificial white stuff production had to haul in for Alar Kivilo's fine lensing of plenti-ful midwinter sequences. Usually estimable composer Mychael Danna contributes one of his least inspired scores. Pic would be boosted by some trims, especially in second act.
