Every bit as unfocused and indulgent as its titular heroine, "Hannah Takes the Stairs" has the unmistakable look and feel of a micro-budget indie produced for a small circle of friends, many of whom are listed in the credits. Some viewers might experience sporadic shocks of recognition while following the interminable interactions of the self-involved twentysomethings in this dreary dramedy by multihyphenate Joe Swanberg ("Kissing on the Mouth"). But empathetic members of the pic's presumptive target audience may still find themselves wishing the characters would just get over themselves. Beyond festival and cable exposure, oblivion awaits.
Working from a script he reportedly concocted in collaboration with his cast, Swanberg follows Hannah (a grating Greta Gerwig), an intern at a Chicago production company, through a series of short-lived relationships that are not love affairs so much as crushes with benefits. She impulsively hooks up with a fellow employee -- played by indie filmmaker Andrew Bujalski ("Mutual Appreciation") -- then pairs off with another co-worker (Kent Osborne), all the while acknowledging her "chronic dissatisfaction." But even the occasional display of casually bared flesh (male and female) isn't enough to generate interest in her misadventures.
Camera (color, HD video), Swanberg; music, Kevin Bewersdorf; sound, Bewersdorf. Reviewed at South by Southwest Film Festival (Spotlight Premieres), March 11, 2007. Running time: 83 MIN.
