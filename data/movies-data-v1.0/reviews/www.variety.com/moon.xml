In the sci-fi drama �Moon,� the apparently sole human inhabitant of a lunar mining base begins experiencing odd phenomena just as he�s about to finish his very lonely stint and return home. U.K.-produced debut feature for advertising whiz Duncan Jones and scenarist Nathan Parker recalls such brainy sci-fiers as �2001: A Space Odyssey� and �Solaris.� But despite its handsome look and good thesping workout for Sam Rockwell, the story stretches a bit thin over feature length. Fantasy fans who don�t require monsters or laser battles will want a look, though overall modest impact suggests wider smallscreen exposure after brief theatrical play.
Opening corporate promo reveals that in the near future, our energy-strapped world discovers a new resource in harvesting lunar rock for Helium-3, an actual but rare Earth substance used in nuclear fusion. After nearly three years manning his station alone -- with only �robotic assistant� Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) for company -- an edgy, exhausted Sam Bell (Rockwell) is more than ready to rejoin his wife and young daughter. But hallucinations begin to occur, one causing him to crash a Land Rover.
He wakes up considerably enfeebled, then questions his sanity anew upon finding a doppelganger -- fitter, and with a hotter temper -- now in residence, also insisting he�s Sam Bell. Is one a clone? Are they both? Is Sam�s three-year work contract even meant to have survived?
These questions are intriguing enough but aren�t played out in especially suspenseful or surprising fashion by director or scribe (working from Jones� original story idea). Instead, �Moon� actually gets a little dull in the later reels, just when it should be peaking in mystery and tension.
There�s not quite enough complexity of incident or character development here, though Rockwell -- who�s become something of a specialist in characters losing their grip (�Snow Angels,� �Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,� �Joshua�) is very good portraying the amiable astronaut�s mental and physical deterioration. (He�s less convincing putting across Sam No. 2�s initial �Top Gun�-style macho bluster.) 
The space station�s mostly white interiors particularly recall �2001,� though Gerty doesn�t quite turn out to be another HAL. Lunar exterior scenes are also nicely handled by the design team�s mix of f/x techniques. Clint Mansell�s atmospheric score is a plus.
