      <text>Isn't it time Steve Zahn grew up? Ever since the '90s, this walking quirk of an actor has pushed his dazed solipsistic zaniness (he's like Michael J. Foxâ€™s hillbilly cousin), but he's 41 now, and it no longer looks cute on him. In the indie dud Management , he's a slacker motel clerk who comes on to a guest &#151; a corporate lonely girl played by Jennifer Aniston in lank brown hair and a why-did-I-ever-say-yes-to-this-script? grimace. She proceeds to not treat him like the benignly annoying stalker he is. The scene in which Zahn, standing outside Aniston's house, performs an off-key-warbling-plus-electric-piano rendition of Bad Company's ''Feel Like Makin' Love'' is obviously intended to be a parody of John Cusack's famous boom-box serenade in Say Anything . But here's a question for contemplation: Just because the moment is meant  to be cringe-worthy, does that make the cringing any less painful?
