      <text>If you've never heard the '60s psychedelic cult band the 13th Floor Elevators, by all means download their nuggets: They had a spooky thrash beauty, and their leader, Roky  Erickson, sang with a full-moon hellcat yowl that bridged the fervor of Van Morrison and the anarchy of Janis Joplin. But this slipshod documentary, a portrait of the drug-and-mental-illness-addled lump Erickson became, is too enamored of his decay. Director Keven McAlester thinks he's making Crumb , but he doesn't give you enough of Erickson in his glory. You're Gonna Miss Me  has the taint of exploitation.
