      <text>A lot of emotions look good on Jonathan Rhys Meyers' sneery, overripe features, but compassion isn't one of them. In the historical dud The Children of Huang Shi , he plays a roving World War II journalist who sneaks into Nanking and glimpses the atrocities there. Yet the movie isn't interested in anything so pivotal. Instead, it traces our hero's Journey Toward Caring as he rescues 60 Chinese orphans. It's like Schindler's List  crossed with The Sound of Music , and Roger Spottiswoode directs it in a stiff, lifeless, utterly dated style of international squareness.
