      <text>In Confetti , three (fake) engaged couples compete to stage the Most Original Wedding in Britain, with a dream house dangled as a prize by editors of the (fake) bridal magazine that lends this frothy improvised British comedy its apt, tossed-in-the-air name. And the (real) Stateside gurus who dream up stuff like My Super Sweet 16 are probably kicking themselves that they didn't copyright the concept first. Must viewing for the Bridezillas set, this winning pageant of gaudy bad taste is the work of some of the U.K.'s most popular comedy performers (among them Martin Freeman from BBC's The Office  and Jessica Stevenson from Shaun of the Dead ), gaily throwing themselves into the earnest implementation of three howler wedding themes: tennis, nudist, and Hollywood musical.
Directed script-free by theater pro Debbie Isitt, the movie emits the piquant odeur  of Waiting for Guffman : Freeman and Stevenson play a drab duo who love musicals but can't carry a tune, and all three couples are assisted by a pair of wedding planners (and life partners) who make Guffman 's Corky St. Clair seem butch. Yanks should be proud, I suppose, that American excess and vulgarity provide fodder for a charming Busby Berkeley finale. Equal opportunists, though, might wish Isitt had set at least one of the three nuptials amid some truly wretched Brit pomp for a change.
