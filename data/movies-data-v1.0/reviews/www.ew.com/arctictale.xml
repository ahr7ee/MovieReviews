      <text>What might be the only thing better than An Inconvenient Truth  at getting  people to care about global warming? Maybe those widely circulated photos of drowning polar bears stranded between melting ice floes. Arctic Tale  &#151; a nature doc following a walrus and a polar bear &#151; lacks single images of that power, and it's too sneaky about the fact that both ''characters'' are in fact composites, but it's a respectable  attempt to get kids who like cuddly animals thinking about death and destruction on a global scale.
