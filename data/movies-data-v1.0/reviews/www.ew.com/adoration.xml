      <text>Atom Egoyan's latest glum puzzle is a meditation on post-9/11 hysteria, but it's too much What's the meaning of terrorism?  cud chewing too late. In Toronto, a teenager (Devon Bostick) stands before a high school class and pretends that his &#8232;father was a terrorist who tried (and failed) to use his wife to blow up an airplane. There &#8232;is much else in Adoration  (a fatal car crash, angry ranting on video chat rooms), but the upshot is that those who appear to be guilty may not be &#151; a muddled &#8232;message for our time.
