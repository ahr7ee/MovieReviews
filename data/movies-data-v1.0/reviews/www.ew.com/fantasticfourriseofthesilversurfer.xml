      <text>If you swept the cosmic dust of the superhero boom into a flimsy dustpan, you'd have the Fantastic Four  franchise. In Rise of the Silver Surfer , Marvel's serendipitously irradiated family must stop a massive, planet-eating plot device by unraveling the secrets of the Silver Surfer, a rapturous screensaver of a creation. He also doesn't talk much, which is a blessing: The dialogue aims young and low, and sounds translated from comic-book Esperanto.
