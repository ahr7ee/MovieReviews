      <text>It's pretty clear by now that characters in sci-fi movies have never seen a sci-fi movie. Otherwise, tomorrowland marines like Sarge (The Rock, finally giving that eyebrow thing a rest), Reaper (The Lord of the Rings ' Karl Urban), and the rest of their rescue squad would know that those suddenly dead scientists on the Martian archaeological outpost &#151; you know, the ones who experimented with chromosomes they found just lying around &#151; surely hatched something evil. Still, by hewing close to James Cameron's Aliens  playbook, Doom  manages to escape the game-to-movie curse that afflicted Resident Evil , House of the Dead , and, well, every other movie based on a game. And unless you've been keeping tabs on how The Rock's career choices mirror Ah-nuld's, there's a nifty reversal at the end that you won't see coming.
