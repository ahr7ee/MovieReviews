      <text>In his first English-language film, the Hong Kong avant-pop auteur Wong Kar-Wai shoots American dive bars in gorgeous hot reds, and he teases out moments of terrific acting &#151; from David Strathairn   and Rachel Weisz   as a bitter, raging couple, and from Natalie Portman   as a Dixie-broad poker fiend with daddy issues. But Norah Jones  , making her big-screen debut as a wistful wanderer, is a beautiful blank, and the fragments barely add up to a movie. My Blueberry Nights  hints that buried in Wong's spicy odd noodlings may be an even better conventional filmmaker.
