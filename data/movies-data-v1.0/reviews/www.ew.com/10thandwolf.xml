      <text>Giovanni Ribisi, with pasty skin and hair slicked back like Dracula's, plays the sort of badass goombah psychopath who smashes a bottle in your face first and asks questions later. The actor seems to be having a good time in 10th &amp; Wolf , but, like everyone around him, he could almost be in a high school theater production of GoodFellas  as staged by Rushmore 's Max Fischer. At least Ribisi's fake-cojones histrionics are fun. The rest of this Donnie Brasco  knockoff, with James Marsden as a Gulf War veteran who goes undercover, is a turgid, ketchup-spattered dud.
