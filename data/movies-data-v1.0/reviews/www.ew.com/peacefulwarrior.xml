      <text>In the ranks of improbable gymnastics coaches, Nick Nolte falls just below the cartoon version of Mr. T (whose adventures on the parallel bars I suggest you YouTube). Nolte plays ''Socrates,'' a magical blue-collar Buddha who gruffly Yodas a college gymnast named Dan Millman (Scott Mechlowicz). The real Millman's personal-growth classic Way of the Peaceful Warrior  is the source for Peaceful Warrior , this self-congratulatory self-help seminar, which plays as high comedy, thanks to Nolte's slurry sensei. Let's just say he smells (to the cynic) a little more Tsingtao than Tao.
