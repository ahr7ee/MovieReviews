      <text>The old rap on Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ) is that he makes the same film again and again, and Revolver  starts out in that snazzy-crime vein, as an ex-con (Jason Statham) plots revenge against a well-dressed gambler (Ray Liotta). Then the movie butts up against the director's newfound pretensions &#151; pseudo-philosophical voice-over, psychobabble, faux-art-film plotting &#151; and turns incomprehensible. Ironically, a few deft shoot-outs make you wish he'd just delivered another straight-on Guy Ritchie flick.
