      <text>Talk about a high-pressure area. Judi and Ron Barrett's children's book has been tantalizing kids' taste buds for &#8232;30 years. So adapting the beloved &#8232;story into a 3-D flick was a risky move. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs  goes down easy enough at first. But even at a svelte 81 minutes, this meal drags on too long (you'll be crying ''Basta! '' by the time it's raining pasta). Saturday Night Live 's Bill Hader is restrained as Flint, a nerdy inventor who transforms the sleepy town of Swallow Falls into a meteorological marvel where the skies pour pizza, burgers, and Gummi Bears. A nice turn from Mr. T keeps the grade (barely) above C level.
