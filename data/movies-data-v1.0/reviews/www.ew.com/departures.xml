      <text>In Departures , this year's Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film, a &#8232;cellist with daddy issues named Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) loses his orchestral gig and lands a job preparing corpses for the ritual Japanese ceremony of encoffination. Like Sunshine Cleaning , this is a gentle comic tale of grisly &#8232;employment opportunity in desperate times. Only Departures  is tender and, at times, rather squishy. It's sure to squeeze the tear ducts of anyone who has lost a parent (hence that Oscar). But Motoki, a droll actor, gives Daigo's embrace of the ''normality'' of death &#8232;a stubborn, touching dignity. Bâ€“
