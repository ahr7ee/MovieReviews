      <text>Is Julianne Moore to the girdle born? In The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio , Moore comports herself once again with Eisenhower-era placidity as an ideal and idealized housewife and mother &#151; a sister in diminished expectations to the perfectly groomed, oxygen-deprived, unhappy women she played in Far From Heaven  and The Hours . Stepping off the pages of a 2001 tribute memoir written by Terry ''Tuff'' Ryan, Moore plays Terry's mother, Evelyn Ryan, a real-life domestic goddess who supported her family with cash and prizes won in jingle contests during the 1950s and '60s. Churchgoing mother of 10 kids and long-suffering wife of a weepy, childish, alcoholic husband (played by Woody Harrelson) who effectively counted as her 11th, this Evelyn is never less than minty fresh in rose-colored shirtwaist dresses, determined to squeeze sweet lemonade from the sour lemons of her circumstances.
Screenwriter Jane Anderson (Normal ) makes her feature directorial debut with this caramelized production, and the tone she employs &#151; a candy-colored perkiness that bathes every triumph, every setback, and every Ryan in the forgiving light of Simpler Times &#151; is very much an aesthetic choice. (I assume the surviving Ryan children, who also make an appearance, approve of the color palette.) As a result, though, Anderson's adaptation is heavy on production numbers in which jingles come to life and light on conveying any real feelings of Eisenhower-era darkness the prizewinner herself might have felt during her decades of marriage to an abusive, drunken man. Here, nostalgia becomes its own form of defiance.
