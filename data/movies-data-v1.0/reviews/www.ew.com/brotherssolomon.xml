      <text>The Jerk  had a high sperm count: It's spawned scores of Edenically simpleminded man-children, from Harry and Lloyd to the Brothers Solomon. These latest offspring, a pair of socially quarantined, home-schooled fr√®res  (SNL 's Will Forte, who wrote the script, and Arnett, doing a sweeter Gob Bluth), are not without their charms: The sheer, animal idiocy beaming from their faces in the opening credits of The Brothers Solomon  creates the film's only moment of uncalculated comic joy. Alas, their quest &#151; giving their dying father the grandchild he always wanted &#151; feels like a cheapo, soft-R retread of the dimwits' progress from Dumb and Dumber , with director Bob Odenkirk dropping Forte's jokes like anvils.
