      <text>In Nobel Son,  Eli Michaelson (Alan Rickman) is a noted chemistry professsor who has just received the Nobel Prize; he's also a lecherous, ill-tempered misanthropic jerk. When the son (Bryan Greenberg) he treats like dirt gets kidnapped by a psychopath (Shawn Hatosy) who is not what he seems, the director, Randall Miller (Bottle Shock ), appears to be trying to cross a bad Elmore Leonard thriller with a bad indie-festival family-angst &#8232; comedy. He gives us the worst of both worlds, parading each superficially clever motif &#151; &#8232;severed thumbs, cannibalism, the magic of Pat Benatar's lyrics &#151; with an amateur's show-off glee.
