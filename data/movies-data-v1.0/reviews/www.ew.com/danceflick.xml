      <text>In this enjoyably dirty-minded sendup of when-ballet-met-hip-hop youth musicals, the Wayans brothers hand the directorial reigns over to their nephew, Damien Dante Wayans, who piles on the stupid/smart gags with just the right what-the-hell abandon. The film riffs on Save the Last Dance , Hairspray , and High School Musical 3 , but what's funniest is its dissection of message-movie piety. In Dance Flick , racial and sexual differences aren't transcended &#151; they're super-sized. As a rotund hoodlum, David Alan Grier does the ultimate break dance from hell.
