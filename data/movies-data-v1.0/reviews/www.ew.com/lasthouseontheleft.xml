      <text>Out for kicks, a family of sadist-sociopaths corners a teenage girl in the woods. She is raped (by the father) and left for dead &#151; and that, no exaggeration, is the lighter half of this desperate-to-be-shocking exploitation dud. The original version of The House on the Left , released in 1972, was the first film directed by Wes Craven, who basically refracted Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring  through the dementia of the Manson family. The movie was vile but terrifying. This remake is merely vile (and dull), with a badly miscast Tony Goldwyn as the raging dad who makes revenge for his daughter's violation look more gratuitously brutal than the crime.
