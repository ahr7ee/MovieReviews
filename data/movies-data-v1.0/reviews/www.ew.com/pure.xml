      <text>Keira Knightley smokes ''gear'' &#151; a.k.a. heroin &#151; with a 10-year-old kid played by Harry Eden in Pure , a British drama filmed in 2002 and released now with Knightley's china-shop mug all over the poster. Although it's a supporting role, Knightley glows with the bound-for-glory newness of an emerging star. Pure , however, belongs to Eden, a remarkably strong child actor, and Deadwood's Molly Parker, broken and affecting as his sweaty, gear-crazy mum. Though he throws a little too much whimsy into the Ken Loach-ian dramatics, director Gillies MacKinnon (Hideous Kinky ) forges a very wrenching and believable bond between Parker and Eden. It seems like it would really suck having a smackhead for a mother.
