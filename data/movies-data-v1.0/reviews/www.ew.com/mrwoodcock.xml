      <text>A few years ago, a comedy like Mr. Woodcock  &#151; in which a self-help author (Seann William Scott) tries to help his mom (Susan Sarandon) realize that her new fianc√© (Billy Bob Thornton), the wicked gym teacher of the title, is the scum of the earth &#151; would've played fine. Uninspired, sure, but sporadically, spasmodically funny. But in this post-Apatow-the-arrested-development-genius world, it can't compete. The only thing worth watching is Sarandon, popping in from a classier reality.
