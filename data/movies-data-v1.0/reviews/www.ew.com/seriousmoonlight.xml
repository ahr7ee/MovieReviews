      <text>In Serious Moonlight , Meg Ryan plays a lawyer who discovers that her husband (Timothy Hutton) plans to leave her for a young thing (Kristen Bell). So she does what any lawyer would do if she were Meg Ryan &#151; duct-tapes him to a toilet, then persuades him to love her again by dint of being Meg Ryan. (Ryan nearly breaks a sweat working so hard to charm.) There's a lot of yelling, cracking wise, and cooing in this creepy rom-com. Curb Your Enthusiasm 's Cheryl Hines directs, from a script by the late filmmaker Adrienne Shelly &#151; a return favor, perhaps, for Shelly's having cast her in Waitress . (Available on cable via on demand)
