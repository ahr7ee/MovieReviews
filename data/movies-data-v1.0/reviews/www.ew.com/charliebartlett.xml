      <text>Appropriating many of the rebel responsibilities of Ferris Bueller and Rushmore 's Max Fischer but little of their fresh charms, the title teen iconoclast  of this antic yet bland comedy is showily updated for our psychotropic age. Rich kid Charlie Bartlett , an (Alpha Dog 's Anton Yelchin) becomes a guru-hero to his classmates, holding shrink sessions in the high school bathroom and handing out prescription elixirs (i.e., antidepressants, Ritalin) to the needy. Robert Downey Jr. is an uncomfortable sight as the school's hard-drinking, overstressed  principal.
