      <text>Everyone uses the four-letter word, not many publications (including EW) print it: That's one marketing hook for this goofily overproduced, frivolous documentary, a distracted, ''hey, look, talking heads say F**K !'' examination of one of the English language's most useful utterances and why the sound packs such a friggin' wallop. Clearly meant to follow where The Aristocrats  went before with more panache, the footage includes chopped-up interviews with F-word fans, celebs, scholars, and F-averse conservatives. Best on the left: Billy Connolly. Most charming on the right: Pat Boone.
