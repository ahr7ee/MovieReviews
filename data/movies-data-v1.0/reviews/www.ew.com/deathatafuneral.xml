      <text>A mysterious guest (Peter Dinklage) with a secret rattles an already dysfunctional clan at a memorial service for the family patriarch. (Perhaps in homage to the funnier The Wrong Box , undertakers first bring...the wrong box.) By the end of Death at a Funeral 's effortful farce about busted British propriety, you may feel that peculiar facial ache that comes from wishing to laugh with no really satisfying release. Working with a broad script by Dean Craig, director Frank Oz goes for American-style physicality, marching his players around a country house in which a toilet, alas, plays a big part.
