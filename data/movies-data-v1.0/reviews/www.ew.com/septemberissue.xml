      <text>There are many documentaries about the fashion world. Some, like Unzipped  (remember when Isaac Mizrahi was the new black?), are impish fun, and a few, like Valentino: The Last Emperor , have been marvelous. But the singular fascination of The September Issue , R.J. Cutler's lusciously revealing fly-on-the-wall portrait of Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue , doesn't hinge on clothes, or glamour, or the sprinkle of stars on display. (Look, it's Jean Paul Gaultier! And Sienna Miller!) It begins with the electromagnetic pull of power.
