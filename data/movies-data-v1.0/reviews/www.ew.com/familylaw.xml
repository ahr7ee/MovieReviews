      <text>Can one make an arresting movie about a completely happy man? Ariel (Daniel Hendler), an unassuming law professor in Buenos Aires, is married to a gorgeous Pilates instructor (Julieta DÃ­az) and dotes on his tyke of a son. Where's the drama? Well, Ariel's own father (Arturo Goetz), a colorful, if unscrupulous, lawyer, wishes Ariel would follow more closely in his footsteps. That's it! That's the entire film! Family Law  is well acted, but if Antoine Doinel had been nearly this serene, Truffaut's career would have petered out after three films.
