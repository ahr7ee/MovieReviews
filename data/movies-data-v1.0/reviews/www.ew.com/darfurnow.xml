      <text>There are wounding tales of rape and murder, of parents watching their children massacred, in this clear-eyed documentary account of the genocide in Darfur. Mostly, though, Darfur Now  is devoted to the efforts of six individuals to stop the madness. They range from a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in the Hague to actor-activist Don Cheadle (one of the producers), who speaks eloquently of how what's happening over there is an assault on the humanity of everyone on earth. That said, the film gets a little ''We can fix this!''  inspirational for a chronicle of such staggering darkness.
