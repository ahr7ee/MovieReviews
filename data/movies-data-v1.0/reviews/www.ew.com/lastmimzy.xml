      <text>A thingy from the future &#151; part toy, part New Agey objet  &#151; falls to earth, and the siblings (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and Chris O'Neil) who discover it hide the alien marvel, E.T. -style, from their parents (Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson). The Last Mimzy , a pleasantly dorky adaptation of Lewis Padgett's 1943 sci-fi story directed by New Line honcho Bob Shaye, bobbles its topicality (Homeland Security has no business here) and its clunky product placement (rah-rah Intel!). But the newcomer kids are delightfully...kidlike. Cosmic bonus: The Office 's Rainn Wilson plays a New Agey science teacher.
