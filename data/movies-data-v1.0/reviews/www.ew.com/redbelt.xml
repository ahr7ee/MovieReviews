      <text>That thing. That thing David Mamet   does in his plays and movies. Like in this one, about an L.A. jujitsu instructor (a soulful Chiwetel Ejiofor) with sad eyes and a Spartan code of honor. That thing Mamet does, with blunt guys mouthing off and doing tricky guy deals. (Inevitably, there's some woman being duplicitous.) That thing Mamet does he does again with feverish effing commitment in Redbelt , his effing Rocky . Mamet regulars Ricky Jay and Joe Mantegna blend well with Mamet newbie Tim Allen  , a treat as a spoiled-rotten aging Hollywood action star.
