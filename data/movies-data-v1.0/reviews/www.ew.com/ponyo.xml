      <text>Ponyo , an emotionally profound, visually thrilling animated reimagining of the classic fairy tale ''The Little Mermaid,'' is another opportunity for the smitten to state the &#8232;obvious: The work of the legendary Japanese animation artist Hayao Miyazaki is both &#8232;unmistakable and inimitable. Forget about Ariel, the romanticized, selectively sexualized Disney mermaid. Miyazaki, whose previous masterpieces include Howl's &#8232;Moving Castle , Princess Mononoke , and the 2002 Academy Award winner Spirited Away , deepens the classic Hans Christian &#8232;Andersen story so that it becomes a parable about keeping a planet in balance, and a vision of multigenerational love.
Employing traditional cel animation to &#8232; produce a fireworks display of inventive &#8232; imagery, Miyazaki's version skips lightly, sweetly, and firmly over gender fussiness to introduce the heroine &#151; Ponyo &#151; as a strong, robust, trusting, loving little fish in the sea. And when Ponyo falls in love with a little boy named Sosuke, she decides that what she wants most (much to the distress of her &#8232;sorcerer father) is to become a little land-based girl. Not surprisingly, big-name fans of the animator lined up to voice the English-language version, among them Tina Fey as Sosuke's mother and Liam Neeson as Ponyo's ecology-minded father. (Listen, too, for Cate Blanchett, Lily Tomlin, and Matt Damon.) Don't tell Walt Disney, but Hayao Miyazaki &#8232;really holds the keys to the magic kingdom.
