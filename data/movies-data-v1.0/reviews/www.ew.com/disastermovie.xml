      <text>Title aside, Disaster Movie  may be the first Airplane! -style parody  that has no overriding concept beyond...skewering a bunch of recent hit films. It should have been called I Love the First Half of 2008 . Since many of the targets (Cloverfield  , Hancock  ,  Kung Fu Panda  ) already have a cheeky self-consciousness, the comedy rarely seems more than a hasty patchwork of cheap-shot allusions. But a few arrows hit their marks. The movie is merciless sending up Juno 's self-satisfied hipster gobbledygook, and it's quite funny to see Hannah Montana  still promoting her tie-in products as she lies crushed and dying under a meteor.
