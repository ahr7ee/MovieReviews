      <text>After Gummo    and Julien Donkey-Boy  , the director Harmony Korine evinces a kind of integrity &#151; he tries never to entertain, and lo, he succeeds. In Mister Lonely , his latest grunge diddle, a Michael Jackson impersonator (Diego Luna  ) lands at a colony of celebrity imitators that's like an insane asylum for the Age of Fame. Samantha Morton   pops up as ''Marilyn Monroe,'' but none of the faux icons comes close to being a character. Instead, they are contrasted with a group of nuns who skydive without parachutes. Could this possibly be a metaphor for Korine's filmmaking? It certainly goes splat.
