      <text>Short story: A couple of '80s schoolboys create a home-video sequel to the first Rambo  movie. Long story: Busy British comedy Son of Rambow  waxes nostalgic about boyhood friendships, school days, amateur video-making, and the glorious grunts of Sylvester Stallone  . (The movie also takes a swipe at conservative Christian sectarianism.) The team who made The Hitchhiker&amp;#39;s Guide to the Galaxy   display plenty of whirligig energy, if not much control or lightness of touch. The nonpros who play the religious angel and devilish bully best friends/junior filmmakers perform like...nice nonpros.
