      <text>Imagine a booze-and-sex-and-snark bad-boy comedy, like The Hangover  or Road Trip , in which male debauchery gets pushed so far that it's at once hilarious, shocking, and brazenly honest. That's this adaptation of Tucker Max's gonzo memoir, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell . Matt Czuchry, in a star performance, plays Tucker like a Ferris Bueller who bloomed into a charming sociopath. Insults fly out of his mouth like shrapnel, but on a bachelor-party jaunt to a strip club, both his pals (Geoff Stults and Jesse Bradford) and the strippers give as good as they get. The film is consistently fun, and Tucker's comeuppance will leave you gasping (if not gagging) with laughter.
