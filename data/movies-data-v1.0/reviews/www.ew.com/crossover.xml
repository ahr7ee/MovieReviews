      <text>Inside an abandoned Detroit train station, past the fires blazing medievally in oil barrels, guys play street ball, a loose form of basketball where money's always on the line and ''razzle dazzle'' wins out over rules. But Crossover  skimps on court-level pyrotechnics (we get a game in the beginning and, of course, a big game at the end, and that's about it) in favor of dry urban melodrama: One player is really aiming for med school, while another (Anthony Mackie, so natural in Half Nelson , so stilted here) flies off the handle a lot.
