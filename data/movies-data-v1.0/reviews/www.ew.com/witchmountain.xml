      <text>In Race to Witch Mountain , Dwayne ''the Rock'' Johnson plays a lonely taxi driver. Is he, per Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle, awaiting the day when a real rain will come and wash the scum off the streets? Hey, maybe he is, But we never find out, because &#151; as this is a remake of the beloved 1975 Disney movie Escape to Witch Mountain  &#151; he's soon too busy helping two cute alien kids avoid government agents and (some sort of extraterrestrial robot assassin) to have time for such apocalyptic thoughts. Helpfully, the planet-hopping children have special talents &#151; telekinesis, telepathy etc. &#151; although it is the high-wattage lovability of Mr Rock that's the real superpower on display here.
