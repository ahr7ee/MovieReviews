      <text>What's the key to the early-19th-century mystery of the Bell family of Red River, Tenn., so traumatized by a ghost (or something) that one family member died? An American Haunting  suggests an answer, not to be spilled here except to say that men are E-V-I-L and women are victims. (Ooh, that old truism.) The unnecessarily famous cast for such a standard, creaking, fake-spooky ghost story (with Bible verses thrown in for good measure) includes Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland as Ma and Pa Bell, both gamely clutching shawls and muskets and such.
