      <text>Young Thomas Turgoose, the spunky non-pro 13-year-old cast as a lonely kid drawn to an early-'80s skinhead gang in this autobiographical period piece by Shane Meadows (TwentyFourSeven ), has a sweet old-fashioned face. But in the right light, his weary eyes resemble those of a mean adult. The changeability serves this sad, menacing, empathetic story well, even if the story is misty in its didacticism: No matter how tough the times, just say no to racism and hatred.
