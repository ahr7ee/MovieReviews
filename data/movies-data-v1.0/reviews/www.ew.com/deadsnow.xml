      <text>In Dead Snow , a group of Norwegian medical students &#151; pals on an Easter vacation &#151; bunk together in a mountain cabin, ready for fun involving skiing, beer drinking, and sex. What they get is an invasion of WWII-era Nazi zombies who haunt the hills. (The undead bastards are gluttons for dining on guts.) Cheery, silly, splattery, and respectful of its elders (and betters, particularly Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead ), this bloody/cheesy subtitled Scandinavian lark is written and directed&#8232; by Tommy Wirkola, who has a nice touch with severed limbs. (Also available, dubbed in English, on cable via on demand )
