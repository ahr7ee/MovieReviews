      <text>The press notes for She's the Man  state that it's a teen update of Twelfth Night  (what's next &#151; Paul Walker in To Party or Not to Party? ), but the historical work it reminded me of most was Soul Man , that vintage '80s piffle in which C. Thomas Howell, in a tan-from-the-can, pretended to be black and was so unconvincing at it that your face curdled into a wince. In She's the Man , Amanda Bynes pastes on sideburns and a shaggy bowl-cut wig and struts around in a prep-school jacket attempting to pass herself off as a boy, but Bynes, with her chipmunk cheeks and goggly eyes, comes off more like some bizarre third sex &#151; Davy Jones after an infusion of estrogen. When she tries to talk ''masculine,'' squeaking out lines like ''Hey, bruthuh!'' in a vaguely hip-hop patois, it's so cheesy-wrong that you stare with a mix of fascination and horror.
She's the Man , in which Bynes has to pretend to be her brother to play competitive soccer, is a role-reversal comedy that has almost too much situational structure &#151; the whole Twelfth Night  thing &#151; and not enough scurrilous hilarity. As an actress, Bynes is wholesome to a fault. She impersonates a teenage boy yet never gives him one good dirty thought.
