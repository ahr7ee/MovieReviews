      <text>As he did in his striking 2005 first feature film, Man Push Cart , about a Pakistani street vendor in New York, perceptive indie filmmaker Ramin Bahrani looks at what others overlook and finds drama in everyday details. Set in a bleak junkyard corÂ¬ner of Queens, where ''auto-body repair'' is indistinguishable from auto-part theft, this gentle drama of getting by in a harsh city jungle features a 12-year-old Latino orphan (Alejandro Polanco) who already knows something about the working world, and his older sister (Isamar Gonzales), who doesn't yet.
