      <text>More like a summer-camp theater project than a studio movie, Shorts ' noodly, kid-oriented action-adventure story follows a magic, wish-granting rock as it falls into various pint-size hands in one all-American suburb. Kid-at-heart filmmaker Robert Rodriguez , whose playtime Spy Kids  trilogy gets a gold star, looks like he's having great fun, but what about the rest of us? Can we wish for a fresher subplot than that of pleasure-deadened grown-ups who live their lives in a stupor of consumerism?
