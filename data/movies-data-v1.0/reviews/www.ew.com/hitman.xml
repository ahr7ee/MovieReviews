      <text>''How does a good man decide when to kill?'' asks Timothy Olyphant's killer-for-hire protagonist in the opening minutes of Hitman . But we have a better question for you, Timothy Olyphant: ''How does such a good actor wind up in this witless piece of action schlock?'' Based on a videogame, Hitman  could be the year's dumbest movie, thanks to an idiotic premise concerning a group of secretive assassins identifiable only &#151; only?  &#151; by the large bar-code tattoos on the backs of their shaved noggins.
