      <text>Dennis (Bobby Coleman) is a weird kid who thinks he's from Mars. David (John Cusack), a science-fiction writer/widower, adopts him anyway. The problem with Martian Child  is that it wants to be a story about outcasts, but Dennis doesn't come off as a cute little rebel. Hiding in boxes, speaking Martian, and stealing pictures of David's dead wife, he comes off as mentally disturbed. Cusack, less guarded than usual, makes a few scenes connect; it's not his fault the movie inadvertently turns you against the overindulgent parenting culture.
