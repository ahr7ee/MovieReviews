      <text>Maybe it's something about the primitive setting (or the even more primitive script), but Will Ferrell lets his bumptiously, merrily masochistic id hang out in Land of the Lost . As Dr. Rick Marshall, a crackpot scientist who gets pulled into an alternate universe of dinosaurs, rubbery goggle-eyed lizard creatures, and apes who look like men in matted Isaac Mizrahi sweaters, Ferrell shrieks in terror like a teenage girl on a roller-coaster ride, and at one point he splatters himself with dino urine. When that stings his eyes, he tries to ease the pain by splattering on more. (It doesn't work.) A giant mosquito sucks the blood right out of him, and an ongoing battle with a T. rex  turns into a kind of 12-step test of our hero's self-esteem, which is roughly a notch below Stuart Smalley's.
You get the feeling that Ferrell is working this hard to beat himself up because Land of the Lost , a movie based on one of the cheesiest '70s Saturday-morning kids' shows ever devised, is anything-goes junk. The film's only conviction is its investment in its total lack of conviction. With three sidekicks to play off &#151; Danny McBride as a good-ol'-boy survivalist, Anna Friel as an eye-candy science groupie, and Jorma Taccone as Chaka, the nattering, boy-faced ape-man &#151; Ferrell ricochets from one pouty-angry sissy-man routine to the next. He even drops a bitchy F-bomb, which more or less signals the desperation of this grab-bag kiddie fantasy. Land of the Lost  has stray amusing &#8232;tidbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered.
