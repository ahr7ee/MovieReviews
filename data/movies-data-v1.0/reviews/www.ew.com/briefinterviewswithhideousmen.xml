      <text>David Foster Wallace's 1999 short-story collection Brief Interviews With Hideous Men  has been turned &#151; by writer-director John Krasinski (The Office ) &#151; into a blunt, scrappy, intermittently perceptive drama. It's a series of toxic-pill relationship vignettes broken up by interviews with the male characters, most of whom prove, beneath their ''enlightened'' liberal-humanist facades, to be lying, lecherous, brutally self-justifying...men. &#8232; At times, the movie could have been called Me and You and &#8232; Every One of the Bastards We Know , but Krasinski preserves Wallace's whooshing roller coasters of words, powered by the fuel of confession.
