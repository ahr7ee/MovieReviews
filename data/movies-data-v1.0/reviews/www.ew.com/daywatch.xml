      <text>Last year's Night Watch  was an almost unwatchably hectic Russian mashup of The Matrix  and vampires, with edits so merciless and mythology so thick and Slavic it was as if you were watching a videogame by Tarkovsky. Day Watch , its gentler sequel, is no less nonsensical as it continues the story of ''Light Ones'' battling ''Dark Ones'' in present-day Moscow. If you don't take it seriously &#151; i.e., if you're able to laugh at the notion of a piece of chalk that undoes time &#151; the sequel is a minor wackjob head trip.
