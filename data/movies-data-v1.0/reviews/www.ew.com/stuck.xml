      <text>Stuart Gordon, the mostly under-the-radar director of Re-Animator   , pops back into view with this amusing trifle &#151; a piece of scuzzy tabloid noir. High on drugs, a nurse's assistant (Mena Suvari  , in fetching cornrows) accidentally plows her car into a sad sack (Stephen Rea) who has lost his job and then his home. He winds up wedged through the windshield, bloody but alive, trapped in the jagged glass. She hides him in her garage, and Stuck  unfolds from there, with the grisly, semi-logical, every-man-for-himself twistiness of a lower-rent Blood Simple   .
