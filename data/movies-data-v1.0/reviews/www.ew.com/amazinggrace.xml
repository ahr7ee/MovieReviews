      <text>Do British middle schoolers get to watch movies during classes, the way American  kids do when their teachers burn off two days by showing a video? If they do, the  unrigorous history lesson Amazing Grace  will soon be waiting for them during their slavery unit. Ioan Gruffudd (Fantastic Four ) plays the abolitionist who pushed Parliament to free Britain's slaves 200 years ago. It's earnest, solemn stuff. The movie sings an old tune &#151; Albert Finney is the blind minister who wrote the title ditty &#151; and it leaves the blood unstirred.
