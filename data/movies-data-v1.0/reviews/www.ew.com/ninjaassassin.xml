      <text>The folks at the MPAA must have been snoozing when Ninja Assassin  came up for its rating. Because this slick slice of martial-arts mayhem from the producers of The Matrix  is awash in blood. It spurts and sprays in geysers. And it never lets up. There's a brutal (and admittedly very cool) fight scene every five minutes. What story there is revolves around a ninja (Korean pop star Rain) who teams with a sassy Europol agent (Naomie Harris) to get payback on the clan who trained him to be a heartless assassin. But let's be honest, killing is this film's business...and business is good.
