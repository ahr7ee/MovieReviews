      <text>Angel-A  shows how director Luc Besson can be French in a way that even the French might despise. Take this awful concoction, set in a high-gloss Paris, in which André (Jamel Debbouze), a sawed-off Algerian loser &#151; he's meant to be Chaplinesque, but comes off more like Luis Guzmán with heartburn &#151; is rescued from self-hatred by his guardian supermodel (Rie Rasmussen), who's like an Aryan dominatrix out of Helmut Newton. Surely, she's the perfect messenger to deliver the news that it's the beauty inside  that counts. Quel  ick. And très  tedious.
