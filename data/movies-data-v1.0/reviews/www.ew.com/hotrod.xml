      <text>Hot Rod 's highlight features the hero &#151; a moped-riding Evel Knievel wannabe (Andy Samberg) &#151; doing a dance in a forest that looks like '70s-spastic Steve Martin reinterpreting Footloose . There are a few other minor laugh sequences in this puttering vehicle for the affable SNL  viral-video star Samberg of ''Lazy Sunday'' fame, but most of them (like a long goof on the phrase ''Cool beans!'') don't really flow into the otherwise conventional frame of the movie. Wait until the best parts pop up on YouTube.
