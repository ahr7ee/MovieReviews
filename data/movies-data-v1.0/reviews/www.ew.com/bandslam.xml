      <text>It's a familiar song: Misfit teens in the process &#8232; of forming a high school band learn life lessons and raise their goblets of rock. But there's enough of a strong filmmaking backbeat in Bandslam  to carry the movie's light tune. Vanessa Hudgens expands her repertory by playing a sarcastic loner rather than the brainy popular girl she's made famous in High School Musical . As a rebellious former cheerleader, &#8232;Aly Michalka perfects the power of hair tossing. And as the movie's sweet, geeky hero, newcomer Gaelan Connell excels&#8232; in wry conversations with the always-welcome&#8232; Lisa Kudrow, who plays his loving mother.
