      <text>Brendan Fraser , with his boyish face and trademark hair flop, hasn't exactly entered the Harrison Ford grumpy-old-man zone, so it's discombobulating to learn that in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor , Fraser's eager daredevil archaeologist has been given an eager daredevil archaeologist son, played by Luke Ford (no relation). Fraser, who at 39 looks perhaps five years older than this kid, needed a wholesome offspring-sidekick like a third arm. Then again, it's not clear that the world needed a third Mummy  movie. Director Rob Cohen spends deadening stretches on the backstory, as if under the delusion it's just as important as the mad creepy-crawlies rising out of the sand. Wrong! In a Mummy  movie, I want my eyes tickled out of their sockets by frenzied digital overkill and couldn't give less of a hoot about the mummy's ''motivation.''
In this one, he's an evil Chinese emperor who rises up, in the person of Jet Li , as a crumbling oxidized metal ghost whose face keeps chipping off. Fairly cool! After an hour of inert exposition, a race through Shanghai gooses the movie alive. Then it plunges back into torpor, and then, at last, it offers a desert battle of skeletons and rusty soldiers worthy of the sound and fury and utter meaninglessness we want from an orgy of pixels.
