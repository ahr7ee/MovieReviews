      <text>It's been a while since the last truly rousing WWI dogfight films: Wings  came out in 1927, Hell's Angels  in 1930. (No, 1966's The Blue Max  isn't good enough.) The time is ripe for a new ''Red Baron'' movie. Which makes Flyboys ' pedestrian drama &#151; about a group of Yanks who move to France to battle tri-wing German fighters &#151; and videogame lameness all the lamer: This is a lost opportunity on an epic scale. The actors are so styled and the dogfights so drippy with CG that, as a period piece, the movie almost looks like it's set in the future.
