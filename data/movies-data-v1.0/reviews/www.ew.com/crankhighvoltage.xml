      <text>After surviving the certain-death plunge that ended 2006's Crank , hitman Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is abducted by goons who transplant his heart into an ailing Chinese crime boss (David Carradine). In its place, Chelios gets an artificial organ with a battery pack that needs constant jolts of outside electricity to keep ticking. Crank High Voltage  treats audiences the same way, administering regular shocks &#151; whether smutty, gory, or just plain weird &#151; lest people's brains get bogged down in the messy plot. The result, an eye-popping strobe of flesh and blood, is as visually stunning as it is absurdly offensive, sure to thrill some while leaving others in a state of outrage-induced catatonia.
