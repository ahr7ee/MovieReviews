      <text>In Pandorum , spaceship crewmen Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid awaken from hyper-sleep in some distant corner of the galaxy to discover they have no memory of what they're doing there. In addition, while they were slumbering in the Land of Hyper-Nod, their vessel has been overrun by homicidal albino ghouls. Are the monsters real or are our heroes suffering from ''pandorum,'' a disease whose symptoms include shaking hands, bleeding noses, and going totally nuts? And, as a follow-up question, how brazenly can one film rip off Alien , I Am Legend , and, somewhat oddly, The Poseidon Adventure ? As always, Foster sells the hell out of his role but non-sci-fi fans may well themselves be driven mad long before the end.
