      <text>The positively untrue story of a bride who falls in love with a woman while walking down the aisle becomes, in this age of The L Word , merely a charming utopian sexual complication in Imagine Me &amp; You . Pretty Rachel (Piper Perabo, inhabiting the Gwyneth Paltrow neighborhood of British accents) is happy enough with her handsome groom, Heck (Match Point 's Matthew Goode). It's wedding florist Luce (Lena Headey), however, who catches Rachel's eye, one mascaraed soul mate finding another in fairy-tale fashion. Not that there's anything wrong with that &#151; but neither is there any real proof of life-changing Ms.-on-Ms. Rightness provided by first-time British writer-director Ol Parker.
Actually, Love Actually 's style DNA exerts far more influence on the chemistry of this blithely synthetic romantic comedy than meaningful sexual identity. Every supporting character, including Luce's depressed mum, Rachel's squabbling parents, and Heck's horndog best pal, is introduced for color rather than consequence. Congratulations are in order for Rachel's sexual awakening, but we might as well applaud the dull girl for falling in love with the nearest bunch of lilies rather than the florist.
