      <text>Wouldn't it blow your mind if you discovered an enchanted CG kingdom in the woods behind your house? In Bridge to Terabithia , the two middle schoolers who stumble onto a whole new world don't seem all that wowed. And the movie &#151; which never decides if it's a fantasy or coming-of-age story &#151; spends a lot of time away from Terabithia; that also leaches out the wonder. The boy seems more excited that Zooey Deschanel is his hottie music teacher than he is to see tree men in the forest.
