      <text>There's comfort to be had in the plot geometry of The Jane Austen  Book Club , a photogenic adaptation of Karen Joy Fowler's 2004 best-seller. Behold six  Austen books, six book-club members who meet over the course of six months, six California lifestyle stories that echo the romantic dilemmas faced by Austen's characters,  and one chance to see The Devil Wears Prada 's Emily Blunt as a prissy high school French teacher who bugs the group with her airs. For a visual bonus, Hugh Dancy appears in bike shorts as the lone male Jane-ite.
