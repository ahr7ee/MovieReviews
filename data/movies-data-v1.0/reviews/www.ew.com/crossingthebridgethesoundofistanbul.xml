      <text>Fatih Akin, the German-born Turkish writer-director of the propulsive culture-clash drama Head-On , returns to the notion of East-meets-West with an inviting music documentary that's more about sound than sight. Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul  emphasizes the unique geography of the city to explain its eclectic music scene, and a generous sampling of performances clinches the argument. As filmmaking, the docu is only travel-diary so-so. But the chance to experience the machine-gun rhymes of ''the Turkish Eminem'' &#151; a young man called Ceza &#151; is priceless.
