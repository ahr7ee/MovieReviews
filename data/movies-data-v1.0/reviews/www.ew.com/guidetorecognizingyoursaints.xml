      <text>The gods of cool appear to have kissed Dito Montiel's fingertips. First a street punk, then a downtown N.Y. hipster and musician, then a Sundance cat &#151; now the first-time director has adapted A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints , his memoir about growing up in ungentrified 1980s Queens, into something kinda fictional, kinda loose, and made a damn interesting piece. He also got Robert Downey Jr. to star as the grown-up ''Dito Montiel'' and the lavishly talented Shia LaBeouf to play young Dito. This gallantly imperfect indie pops with attitude.
