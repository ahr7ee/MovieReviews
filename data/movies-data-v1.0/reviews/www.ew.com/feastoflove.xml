      <text>Feast of Love , Robert Benton's bobos-in-love ensemble drama, adapted from the Charles Baxter college-town novel, is far too cloyingly pleased with its own humanity. Greg Kinnear, as a Portland coffee-bar owner who loses his wife (Selma Blair) to another woman, is the divorcé as sad-eyed puppy, and Morgan Freeman, as a professor recovering from the death of his son, lays on the life-affirming pensées. Radha Mitchell, playing a real estate agent trapped in a sordid affair, has vibrance, but the film wastes no time reducing her to another soddenly ''innocent'' romantic.
