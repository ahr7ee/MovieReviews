      <text>In The Uninvited  an unstable teen (Emily Browning) suspects her mom was killed by her dad's hot new fianc√©e (Elizabeth Banks , with cleavage far perkier than her TV-movie line readings). Horror standbys like mangled corpses and stone-faced children pop up regularly, but sibling directors Charles and Thomas Guard haven't quite nailed the genre's rhythms: Their frights tend to loiter onscreen just long enough for us to see that they aren't all that scary in the first place.
