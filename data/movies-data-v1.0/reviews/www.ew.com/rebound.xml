      <text>It is a far more subdued Martin Lawrence we have before us in Rebound , mellower than the one who bounced around the Bad Boys  movies. Here he brings a sedate (at times sedated-looking) touch to college hoops coach Roy McCormick, whose early-career wins have been obscured by bad behavior and endorsement-mongering (something the brand-dotted film itself doesn't exactly eschew). Barred indefinitely from the game, Roy opts for a high-concept redemption: In a cynical PR ploy, he finishes the season as coach of his old middle school team. Naturally, perfunctorily, he's won over by his scruffy squad of bad-news ballers. The whole thing feels like a half-day of community service, which Lawrence walks through good-naturedly.
