      <text>I'm not generally a big fan of tribute concerts, but this is a glorious exception. Yes, there were moments I wished that Leonard Cohen himself, with that voice of darkest gravel, had shown up on stage to do some of his songs (he appears, backed by U2, for one studio-shot number). But the performers, who include Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, and a startling tremolo-voiced singer named Antony, get so possessed by the words and melodies they're singing that you're transported by the sheer drama of their passion for Cohen's music. In Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man , the concert is mixed with interviews with the 71-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter, and he's a charmingly self-deprecating raconteur. Lofty claims by Bono aside, you hardly need an English degree to hear the lyrical prose-poem beauty of songs like ''Everybody Knows'' or the great ''Hallelujah,'' and this movie has moments so gorgeous they brought me to tears.
