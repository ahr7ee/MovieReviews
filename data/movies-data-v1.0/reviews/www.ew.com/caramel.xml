      <text>The kvetches of regulars at a cheery Beirut beauty salon couldn't be more familiar &#151; and that's the slender charm of Caramel , a Lebanese variation on sweetly soapy dramas about Women Who Bond With Wet Hair. Among the femme woes: One lady's got a married lover; another a fear of aging; a third a crazy sister. Then again, as Steel Magnolias ' bride-to-be, Julia Roberts never had to deal with a stumper like considering a surgical ''restoration'' of her virginity before marriage to her Muslim fianc√©.
