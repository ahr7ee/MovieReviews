      <text>We've rarely seen Vancouver as we see it in Everything's Gone Green : as Vancouver. On a break from playing Seattle or Manhattan, the city gets to flaunt its emerald foliage, which is enough to give an unusual shine to this agreeable twentysomething-angst comedy scripted by novelist Douglas Coupland. The story &#151; a guy (Paulo Costanzo) who works for the lottery gets mixed up in money laundering &#151; is slight, but an appealing cast and lots of scenic leafery make Green  feel fresh.
