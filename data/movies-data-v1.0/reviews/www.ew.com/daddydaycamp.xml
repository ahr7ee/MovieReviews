      <text>Because he's an Oscar winner with a rep now for headlining turkeys, watching Cuba Gooding Jr. in trash like Daddy Day Camp  almost hurts. At this point, you just feel so bad  for him. Filling in for Eddie Murphy in a septically humored kiddie sequel to Daddy Day Care , Gooding gives a mug-job performance that consists mainly of reacting (again and again) to nasty smells. Fred Savage of The Wonder Years  directs, and it also stings to think of little Kevin Arnold reduced to pantsing his actors from behind the camera for a laugh that never comes.
