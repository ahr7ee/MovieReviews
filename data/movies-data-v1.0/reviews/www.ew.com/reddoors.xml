      <text>Named for the traditional Chinese color of good luck, the gentle indie drama Red Doors  is really more in the rosy pink range of the color palette than a more primary emotional hue. Although the Chinese-American Wong family can boast an impressive range of modern crises &#151; big sis is about to marry a yuppie bore, middle sis falls for an actress, dad's a serial suicide attempter, etc. &#151; writer-director Georgia Lee never leaves any doubt that the bonds of ethnic family devotion are a charm against any woe more serious than an engagement to the wrong white guy.
