      <text>Never mind about the Morgans, a squabbling Manhattan couple headed for divorce who become accidental witnesses to a murder in this labored romantic comedy. In Did You Hear About the Morgans? , Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker ply their cute trademarks (his befuddled British grimace, her la-di-da New York sass) like grim, incompatible partners in a Hollywood business deal. You should hear instead about Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen, who whip up cowboy fun as married U.S. marshals assigned to protect the pair in Wyoming.
