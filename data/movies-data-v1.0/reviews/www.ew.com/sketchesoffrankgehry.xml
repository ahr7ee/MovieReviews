      <text>A mutual admiration society comes to order in Sketches of Frank Gehry  when, mini-DV camera in hand,  famous filmmaker Sydney Pollack circles around his friend, the equally famous architect of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and favorite of entertainment celebrities who want him to design their houses; Gehry sketches and free-associates about how he's not nearly the menschy aw-shucks pussycat from Canada he appears to be but rather a wily, complicated L.A. lion. Meanwhile, another camera circles around the famous filmmaker. And danged if the seductive documentary &#151; Pollack's first &#151; doesn't come to resemble a Gehry building itself, all brash, eye-catching, a tad vain, and attractively neurotic.
