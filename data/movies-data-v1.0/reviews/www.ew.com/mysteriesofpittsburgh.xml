      <text>The paradox of a truly atrocious literary adaptation is that everything on screen &#151; a crummy postcollegiate job, a love triangle, even a &#8232;burglary &#151; must be embedded with little wisps of higher ''meaning,'' and therefore ends up meaning nothing at all. In The Mysteries of Pittsburgh , a stillborn rendering of Michael Chabon's first novel, Jon Foster plays Art Bechstein, the son of a Jewish gangster (Nick Nolte), but he comes off as the dullest of WASP preppies. His fascination with a young couple &#151; heartfelt Jane (Sienna Miller) and her pretentious, chopper-riding, bisexual boyfriend Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) &#151; &#8232;plays like Gossip Girl  written by a bad F. Scott Fitzgerald imitator.
