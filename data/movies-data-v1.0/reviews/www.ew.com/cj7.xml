      <text>What could possibly have possessed Stephen Chow, the mad scientist of slapstick chopsocky who made Kung Fu Hustle  (2004), to follow up that psychedelic pinwheel of a movie by entangling himself in CJ7 , the gooey tale of a poor little Hong Kong schoolboy who befriends a fur ball from outer space? The cuddlebug in question may bear an abstract resemblance to E.T. (Chow's stated inspiration), but he's really closer to Gizmo in Gremlins  crossed with a Chicken Little who got washed through the rinse cycle. His ''mischief'' is trivial and charmless, and so is the movie.
