      <text>Girls just want to have fun &#151; and cheer their team at a World Cup soccer event. But that's not easy in Iran, where women are banned from public sporting events. Those caught sneaking in are detained by bewildered boy soldiers in Offside , Jafar Panahi's wonderfully funny, outspoken shaggy-dog story, a light counterweight to his sadder 2000 feminist drama The Circle . Absurdity reaches a peak in a hilarious set piece involving a guard, a ''prisoner,'' and an escorted trip to the men's stalls when a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
