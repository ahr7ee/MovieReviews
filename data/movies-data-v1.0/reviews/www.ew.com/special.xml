      <text>After signing up for trials of a new happy pill, a geeky parking cop (Michael Rapaport) develops superhuman powers &#151; or so he thinks. Sounds like a great Jim Carrey vehicle, but Special  is dead serious &#151; and set on making you think instead of laugh. The result is a minor-key riff on Don Quixote  that struggles against heavy-handed plotting and the awkward humor of a man in a hand-sewn bodysuit running headfirst into walls. But thanks to Rapaport's brio in embracing the hero's drug-induced delusions, the movie is less a failure than a noble experiment gone awry.
