      <text>Director Katherine Dieckmann's comedy is about the messy everyday hysteria that too many odes to parenthood leave out. As Eliza, a former bohemian trying to hold on to her ''creative'' side even as she's become a frazzled mother of two, Uma Thurman turns every task &#151; shopping for a birthday party, retaining a parking space &#151; into an operatic fit of neurosis. She's quite funny, but her performance is at once winning and overstated. Parenthood  seems only half aware of Eliza's real  problem: that she thinks she's superior to the choices she's made.
