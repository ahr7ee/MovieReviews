      <text>Rowan Atkinson, his face in Mr. Bean's Holiday  as pinched and gleaming as a Richard Nixon mask, is still doing his bit to keep classic screen comedy alive. Once again, Mr. Bean, the childlike British idiot &#151; he's the walking id as Twit of the Year &#151; tries to extricate himself from the mishaps he creates, which only results in more spectacular disaster. On a holiday to France, Bean eats oysters (a great joke), then gets stranded in the country, which for a while strands the film. But Atkinson's goofball grotesquerie never lets up &#151; right through to the inspired finale, which could have been called A Day at the Cannes Film Festival .
