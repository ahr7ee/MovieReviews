      <text>Movies based on videogames, like the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider   or Resident Evil   franchises, tend to be hollow, hyperactive FX-laden blowouts. Max Payne  has the hollow part down pat, but there's nothing active about it. It's just a grindingly inert death-wish thriller in which Max (Mark Wahlberg ), a stone-cold detective whose wife and infant were mysteriously murdered, tries to solve the crime and exact his revenge. The movie is a series of glum interrogation scenes that lead nowhere special, with a not-quite-sci-fi urban murkiness that makes it look like someone was trying to shoot Blade Runner   in Cleveland.
