      <text>Appaloosa  is a Western that tries to be square and hip, light and dark, all at the same time. Maybe it's no surprise that the results are mixed. Ed Harris , who directed the film &#8232;(it's his first time behind the camera since Pollock   eight years ago), also stars as Virgil Cole, a roving freelance law enforcer of&#8232; the 1800s who shows up in the town of &#8232;Appaloosa  along with his taciturn sidekick, Everett (Viggo Mortensen ). For a price, they offer to rid the town of Randall Bragg,&#8232; a sneering bully and killer played by Jeremy Irons  in what could almost be a grungier&#8232; impersonation of Daniel Day-Lewis  in There Will Be Blood  . Irons is enjoyably nasty, enough to make you wonder why no one thought to cast him in a Western before.
Harris, for his part, comes off as a classic sure-shot protector &#151; that is, until he beats up a loser in a bar with so much more violence than is necessary that the film seems to be saying this lawman is a bit of a sociopath, too. (The actor's icy gleam certainly suggests it.) The movie, though, pulls back on this idea, and after that scene Virgil is never as interesting. Appaloosa  is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological  duel. Ren√©e Zellweger , as the peach-blossom-fresh Allison, is the most amoral character here &#151; a woman who loves whomever's around &#151; but except &#8232;for her, Appaloosa  is a throwback to the age when Westerns were quaint.
