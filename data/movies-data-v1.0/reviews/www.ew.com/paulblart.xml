      <text>The title of this farce about an overeager &#8232; security guard (Kevin James) suggests a one-joke trudge. But Paul Blart: Mall Cop  has a few &#8232; surprises in store. The biggest is James, an &#8232; unexpectedly nimble master of the face-plant, the failed jump, and the lopsided tumble. The &#8232; former King of Queens  star also proves to be a warm leading man who grounds the movie as &#8232;it morphs into a loopy heist thriller after a promising start as something entirely &#8232; different: a gentle comedy of suburban underachievement.
