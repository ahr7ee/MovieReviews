      <text>It's becoming a bit tiresome watching Kevin Bacon suffer, and he isn't done any favors by this thudding weeper, which Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) directed. Bacon plays an engineer who fails to stop his passenger train from slamming into a car, killing the depressed woman who planted it on the tracks. It's contrived enough that Bacon illegally ''adopts'' the woman's young son. Did I mention that his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) has terminal cancer? Rails &amp; Ties  is like one bad TV movie that slammed into another.
