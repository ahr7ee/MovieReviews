      <text>It's a law of nature that Paris Hilton is more beautiful when she keeps her mouth shut. Her voice betrays her by making her sound much worse than bitchy; it makes her sound common . In The Hottie &amp; the Nottie , Hilton is the babe whom Joel David Moore &#151; a tart young clown who's like Tom Green crossed with Paul Giamatti &#151; has lusted after since the first grade. But to get to her, he's got to find a beau for her best pal (Christine Lakin), a walking one-joke troll (rotten teeth, monobrow, toenail from hell). The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie &amp; the Nottie , a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep.
