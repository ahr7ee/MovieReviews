      <text>Sad tidings, Dickens scholars: Despite its title,  Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties , this unnecessary sequel to 2004's unnecessary Garfield: The Movie  has little in common with A Tale of Two Cities . It's closer to The Prince and the Petit Bourgeois : The furry bag of CG jelly strenuously billed as ''the world's favorite cat'' trades places with feline royalty, giving a host of British thesps (Bob Hoskins, Tim Curry) the opportunity to debase themselves as animal voices. In the ''flesh,'' Garfield himself (voiced by Bill Murray) is once again strikingly unlikable, a bloated, bingeing fascist.
