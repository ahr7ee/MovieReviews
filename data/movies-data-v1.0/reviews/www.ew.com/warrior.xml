      <text>He's bound by honor and indenture to a corrupt warlord in a feudal past. But a crisis of conscience turns a fighter in a remote region of India into a hunted pacifist in The Warrior . And from the moment Lafcadia (Irfan Khan) lays down his sword, he's on a run for his life against punishing henchmen. Asif Kapadia's blazing feature debut, a gorgeously photographed saga with a fine sense of the way place shapes personality, has won numerous awards in the filmmaker's native Britain (the film was first released in 2002). That the Hindi-language drama appears in the U.S. only now is one of those mysteries of Miramax, yet another saga of acquisition followed by long-delayed release retold in the empire's final days.
