      <text>Had blaring news of Owen Wilson's personal crisis not reached his public so close to the release of The Darjeeling Limited , Wes Anderson's picaresque story of three brothers (Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody) who carry their emotional baggage on a train voyage across India would still resonate with vivid sadness. His head outlandishly bandaged in contradiction with the insouciance of his surfer-blond hair, Wilson's character is the one sibling among the three who has actively tried to hurt himself in response to family unhappiness: Father is dead, and a drifty, self-absorbed mother (Anjelica Huston) ignores her sons while searching for her own bliss in a Himalayan nunnery. Now he is trying to reestablish kinship, and he's up against resistance. Estranged from one another, each son is a quirky piece of work in his own right; together on a train, they're a rolling family-therapy experiment.
This is familiar psychological as well as stylistic territory for Anderson after Rushmore  and The Royal Tenenbaums . But there's a startling new  maturity in Darjeeling , a compassion for the larger world that busts the confines of the filmmaker's miniaturist instincts. (A jolting, unironic plot turn may even shock.) I don't know which came first &#151; inspiration provided by the beauty and complexity of India, or an attraction to India because of a wiser heart. But either way, foreign travel is a growth opportunity for these passengers.
