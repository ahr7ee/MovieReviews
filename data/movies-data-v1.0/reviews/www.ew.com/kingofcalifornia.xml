      <text>In this surprisingly fresh handling of indie quirk, an unstable, jazz-musician father (Michael Douglas) enlists his long-suffering,teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) in a search for Spanish gold buried under a banal Costco. Much of the fizz in King of California , writer-director Mike Cahill's feature debut about the thin line between California dreamin' and real mental illness, comes from a liberated Douglas &#151; loose, hairy, and having a blast &#151; as the Don Quixote dad. It's as if the star finally gets to integrate all his onscreen personas, all at once.
