      <text>The 3-D animation work in Fly Me to The Moon  is brisk and sweet, even if the script veers toward fussy and lame in this tot-level retelling of the historic 1969 Apollo 11  moon mission. The focus isn't on the human astronauts and their giant leap for mankind, but on three fictional, boy-like houseflies who, in the name of adventure, hitched a ride in the spacecraft. It's a kick to see actual moonwalker Buzz Aldrin at the end, but must he really assure kids that the spacecraft was, in fact, free of contaminants?  Oh, phooey on pedants.
