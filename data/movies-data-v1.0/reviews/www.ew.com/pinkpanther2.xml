      <text>Taking Inspector Clouseau into his fifth decade of bumbling, Steve Martin  does respectable riffs on Peter Sellers' demented obliviousness. He artfully gibberizes words like hamburger, sniggers at his own deductive Ã©lan, and does slapstick battle with everything from wine bottles to the Pope's miter. Martin, though, is so respectful of the role that he doesn't really make it his own; he does warmed-over Sellers instead of blissed-out Martin. When a series of world artifacts disappears, Clouseau is placed in charge of a dream team of detectives (Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, etc.), which gives him too many straight men. The Pink Panther 2  provides genial chuckles, but it's never excitingly rude.
