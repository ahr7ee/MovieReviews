      <text>I never saw the original structure &#151; i.e., David Greig's play about the architect of a failed Glasgow housing project. But first-time writer-director Matt Tauber's adaptation, with Anthony LaPaglia as the designer of rotten Chicago housing and Viola Davis as a resident who wants the joint razed, sure feels like Tauber has done some fussy renovating. Every character in The Architect  is crazily stuccoed with crisis, including Isabella Rossellini as LaPaglia's unhappy wife, Heroes ' Hayden Panettiere as miserable daughter, and Sebastian Stan as sexually confused son.
