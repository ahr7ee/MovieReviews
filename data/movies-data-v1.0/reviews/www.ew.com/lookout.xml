      <text>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as a fellow who has suffered serious head trauma, comes up with such a moody Method assemblage of twitches, tics, and guilty Memento  mannerisms that he's not much fun to watch. The Lookout , the first movie directed by screenwriter Scott Frank (Out of Sight ), is a thriller that wheezes along on bits and pieces of ''character.'' The hero gets hoodwinked by a local scuzz (Matthew Goode) into assisting in a bank robbery, which puts us in the unpleasurable position of feeling sorry for a protagonist too out-of-it to grasp what the audience already knows.
