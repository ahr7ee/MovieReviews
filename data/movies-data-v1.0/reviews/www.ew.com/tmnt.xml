      <text>Long ago, I knew the theme song to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  cartoon series by heart; I lined up for the 1990 live-action epic on opening night. So it burns to report that this all-CG reboot is missing the goofy excitement of the old TMNT . By way of meager update, our green crime-busters now fight a messy panoply of villains and monsters instead of the fearsome Shredder, and sidekick April O'Neil (the voice of Sarah Michelle Gellar) trades in her yellow pantsuit for 21st-century Lara Croft gear. Also: not enough pizza.
