      <text>The idea of a horror prequel is annoying. We know nobody from the family of maniacs in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning  will die because we already saw them all alive in 2003's TCM: A New Hope . That means anyone looking for the returning Sheriff Hoyt to get punished for R. Lee Ermey's grody overacting here is screwed. So is this movie's youthful cast, who number only four so that they may be tortured slowly &#151; it's the modern mode of horror &#151; and artlessly. Unlike Hostel  or Wolf Creek , TCM:B  is rank and depressing.
