      <text>Isn't it time someone made a kiddie comedy starring Triumph the Insult Comic Dog? I know, I know &#151; he's a bit racy for the preteen set. But the naughtiest word to come out of Triumph's mouth is ''poop,'' and any random three minutes of his hilarious hot-pepper razzing has more surprise and wit and sheer barbed fun than the soggy-cardboard excuse for a talking-canine romp that is Beverly Hills Chihuahua . Chloe, the pampered white pooch of the title, is voiced by Drew Barrymore as the most innocuously adorable of princesses; after landing in the street, she takes a lifetime in dog years to get down to Mexico, where she joins a Chihuahua revolution. You could say Beverly Hills Chihuahua  is Lady and the Tramp  meets Viva Zapata! , but seriously, I've seen zestier attitude in a Purina commercial. While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line.
