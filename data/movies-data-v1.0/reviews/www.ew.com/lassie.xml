      <text>Not many animals are more emotive than collies: those anxious eyes, the long face, that occasional humanoid smile. This is why Lassie is a legend. And Lassie , a franchise reboot more successful (to my eye) than Batman Begins , is about as good as a Lassie movie can be. Taking after the original 1940 novel, the film's set in pre-WWII Britain, and Lassie, sold because times are tough, must travel a picaresque 500 miles to return home to little Joe (Jonathan Mason). Maybe I'm a sucker for dogs, but my eyes welled up. Twice. Woof!
