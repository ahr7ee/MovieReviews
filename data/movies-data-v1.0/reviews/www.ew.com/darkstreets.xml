      <text>Dark Streets , a pre-WWII-set oddity, attempts to marry two faded genres: the musical and film noir. Mad Men 's Gabriel Mann stars as a playboy investigating the supposed suicide of his father. Meanwhile, the fact that he owns a nightclub provides the excuse to feature some vibrantly choreographed, extravagantly costumed song-and-dance numbers. Alas, the flimsy plot &#151; less a whodunit than an isn't-it-screamingly- obvious-that-that-guy-done-it! &#151; will have thriller fans singing the blues.
