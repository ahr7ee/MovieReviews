      <text>How much do I want to believe in America 2.0 as a place where a Suit might help factory workers survive hard times? Enough to swallow New In Town , a gentle, traditional (like, from the last century) romantic comedy in which Ren√©e Zellweger  teeters in high heels as a brittle singleton executrix who relocates to a Fargo-adjacent burg and discovers the virtues of  ''square'' Christian values. Bonus discovery: a cute, available man. Harry Connick Jr.  plays Mr. Darcy in a pickup truck.
