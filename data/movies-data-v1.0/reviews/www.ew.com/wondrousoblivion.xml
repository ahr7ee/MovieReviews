      <text>It's working-class England, 1960. A Jamaican family moves in next door to the Jewish Wisemans, whose young David (Sam Smith) is a kid so wide-eyed he likes to exclaim ''Wondrous oblivion!'' to self-diagnose his own wide-eyedness. Soon David is learning a lot about cricket &#151; and racial tolerance, natch &#151; from his good neighbor (Delroy Lindo, who's the best thing here). Wondrous Oblivion  goes awry in its sloppy racial drama, and although the cricket-training montages are good, they're still training montages, and this is just that kind of overfamiliar movie.
