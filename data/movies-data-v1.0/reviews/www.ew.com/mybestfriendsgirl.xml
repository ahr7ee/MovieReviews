      <text>Desperately in love with Alexis (Kate Hudson ), nice guy Dustin (Jason Biggs ) hires his obnoxious best friend Tank (Dane Cook ) to treat her like crap so she will come running back into his nice-guy arms. But Alexis feels like she hasn't bedded enough jerks in her life, so she actually looks past Tank's butthead routine, then falls for him. Isn't the problem with this romcom obvious? The three main characters are pitifulâ€”losers, all. The actors (especially Alec Baldwin , as Tank's horndog dad) elevate the material slightly, but such piffle will just fill you with longing...for a better movie.
