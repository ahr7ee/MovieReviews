      <text>This splatter primer from Project Greenlight -anointed director John Gulager annotates itself raw with self-awareness and winky excess but its glimmers of true ramshackle abandon are decidedly throwaway (an impromptu amputation here, a face giddily ripped off there). Spazzing through its archetypal narrative (fractious strangers, trapped in a seedy building, fend off beasties), Feast  isn't quite demented enough to reach Raimi-an heights, but Gulager uses parts of the monster-movie buffalo even the buffalo didn't know existed.
