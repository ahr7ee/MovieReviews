      <text>The city is an inky maze of tenements and skyscrapers and back alleys, and the dialogue is so hard-boiled you could just about break your tooth on it. The hero, with his fedora, trench coat, Lone Ranger mask, and bloodred necktie &#151; one of the only slashes of color on display &#151; is a former detective who has become a ghost, but there's nothing particularly supernatural about his attitude. Dead or alive (or somewhere in between), he's the dame-slapping tough guy of a thousand film noirs and film-noir knockoffs.
The Spirit , an adaptation of the legendary comic strip created by Will Eisner in 1940, was directed by Frank Miller , who showed Eisner's influence in the creation of his graphic novels Batman: The Dark Knight Returns  and Sin City . The movie is heavy &#151; one might even say mythic &#151; with the reverent weight of cross-generational pedigree. But if, like me, you stand outside the circle of comic-book obsessives, The Spirit  comes off as just another ludicrously knowing and mannered noir pastiche, full of burnt-end romance and ''style,'' but robotic at its core. It's like the 2005 movie version of Sin City   without all that arresting Day-Glo splatter. The Spirit (Gabriel Macht) must face down the Octopus, a baddie who wants to acquire a vase that holds the blood of Hercules (to make him immortal); he's played by Samuel L. Jackson  with a cackle that is never quite dangerous. As the vamps, Eva Mendes  and Scarlett Johansson  might be posing for a fashion spread with just one note to play &#151; gorgeous high-bitch mockery. Miller stages it all with sleek angularity, but it's the film's clich√©s that seem to have lived forever.
