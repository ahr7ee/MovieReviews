      <text>In this comedy set in London, Heather Graham   has acquired a crisp and saucy British accent  , which somehow makes her seem the blond twin of Helena Bonham Carter. Graham is charming, but Miss Conception  is a cloddish biological-clock bedroom farce. She plays a thirtysomething yuppie, with a baby-phobic boyfriend, who learns that she has just four days to get pregnant (something about being down to one egg). She spends more or less every scene trying, and failing, to shag someone new &#151; a scenario saved from yuckiness only by its utter contrived sterility.
