      <text>Curb Your Enthusiasm 's Jeff Garlin makes his feature writing-directing debut in I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With , a wry movie that, packed with his well-known friends and scored intermittently to bouncy accordion music, plays like a softer episode of Curb . He stars as a Chicago actor hoping for love and weight loss, and the movie would feel too wispy and minor if not for a romantic subplot matching him with Sarah Silverman as a crazy ice cream vendor. Garlin's the first director to really exploit the menace behind Silverman's funny-hot-chick persona; if only for a scene or two, the results cut surprisingly deep.
