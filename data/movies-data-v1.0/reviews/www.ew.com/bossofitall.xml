      <text>Even when he isn't being the dogmatic scold of the Dogville  trilogy, Lars von Trier fashions his cinematic pranks like daggers. In The Boss of It All , though, the blade could use some sharpening. An executive (Peter Gantzler) hires an actor (Jens Albinus) to impersonate his company's (nonexistent) Mr. Big. The actor's inept performance is not only believed &#151; it purges the company's sins. This satire of empty-suit capitalism has scalding moments, but most of it suggests Being There  meets The Office  gibberized into theater of the absurd.
