      <text>In 1932, a kid grandly named Yankee Irving finds a talking baseball named Screwie (voiced by Rob Reiner) in a New York sandlot, and they set off to return a talking baseball bat (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) to Babe Ruth. Co-directed by Christopher Reeve (who died during production), Everyone's Hero  re-creates Depression-era America with surprisingly agreeable anachronistic panache, but a sassy ball and bat don't cut it as compelling cartoon characters, and the not-so-human humans never quite do either (Babe Ruth looks like Shrek).
