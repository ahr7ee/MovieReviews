      <text>This surprise-free comedy stars the ever-louder Martin Lawrence as an overprotective dad who commandeers a trek his daughter (Raven-Symon√©) takes from their Midwest home to her dream school in D.C. Making pit stops for lame gags involving Tasers, skydiving, and the family's pet pig, College Road Trip  is at its best when it drops any pretense of plot for sheer goof (as when a Japanese sightseer belts ''Sister Christian'' on a karaoke tour bus), and at its  worst when Lawrence manages to out-ham even his porky four-legged costar.
