      <text>''Presented'' by Martin Scorsese, the Italian immigration drama Golden Door  is a sluggish procedural on what it was like to make the journey to Ellis Island back in the day. As a Sicilian widower (Vincenzo Amato) leads his mother and two sons overseas, we don't see that much that Chaplin didn't cover when he made The Immigrant  in 1917. Despite a few welcome bits of whimsy, and the lovely presence of The Science of Sleep 's Charlotte Gainsbourg as a sad-faced Englishwoman on the boat, Door  feels as long as a transatlantic voyage.
