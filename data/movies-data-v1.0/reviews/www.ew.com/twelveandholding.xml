      <text>Five years after his feature debut, L.I.E. , with its molten core of suburban pedophilia, director Michael Cuesta returns to the world of dangers for preteens in nice houses with 12 and Holding . And this second visit, with its insistence on extremes of sexuality, violence, and cartoon obesity (an adolescent girl with a crush on a grown man dresses like a Desperate Housewife; the acts of bullies lead to tragedy; a fat kid resents his even fatter parents), makes Cuesta's interest seem more obsessive than artistically daring. The young cast is terrific, giving the stories unearned weight.
