      <text>This dank and rhythmless ''psychological'' potboiler was directed by Jamie Babbit, who made 2000's But I'm a Cheerleader , and though she has shifted tones from shrill camp to moody angst in The Quiet , she still thinks in stereotypes so thin that they put you to sleep the moment they open their mouths. Elisha Cuthbert, who's trying to be the Meryl Streep of Maxim  bimbos, is the bitchy and privately troubled daddy's-girl cheerleader, and Camilla Belle is the shrinking-violet deaf girl who stays with Cuthbert's family and learns its dark (yawn) secret.
