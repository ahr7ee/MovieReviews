      <text>Shut up or die : It's the tagline of Ontario auteur Bruce McDonald's crazy-cool, low-budget horror flick for a reason. This one-of-a-kind zombie film, named for the provincial Canadian town in which it's set, stars Stephen McHattie as a cantankerous radio shock-jock broadcasting out of a crummy church basement, who fights back when zombies attack on a snowstormy Valentine's Day. The means of infection? Tainted language! Think of this witty, economically gory little tour de force as 28 Days Later  written by &#8232;linguist Noam Chomsky. Pontypool  is the perfect antidote to swine flu hysteria. (Available on cable via on demand )
