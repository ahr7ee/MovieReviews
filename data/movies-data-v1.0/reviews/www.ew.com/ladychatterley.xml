      <text>You think you know the story of the genteel lady who finds sexual bliss with a rough gamekeeper. But you do not &#151; not like in Lady Chatterley , Pascale Ferran's startling, womanly adaptation of a lesser-known, more direct version of D.H. Lawrence's famous novel, one of three he wrote. There's an adult life force in every frame of this luxuriously paced work, even in the sight of rain and a lady's stocking. And there's emotional as well as physical nakedness in the performances of Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coulloc'h as lovers who talk through touch.
