      <text>The comedy concept is solid: Jeremy Piven plays a hard-driving used-car salesman &#151; not such a stretch, right? &#151; brought in with his freelance team to save a failing small-town dealership. It's the execution that's out of alignment in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard , a slightly dinged endeavor from the makers of Talladega Nights : Barely controlled scenes of genial, scattershot political incorrectness (sexual, racial, you name it) bump up awkwardly against a soft, sad story of economic downturn. Ed Helms and Ving Rhames score laughs. But the breakout is Step Brothers ' Kathryn Hahn as the tough (sales)girl who keeps up with the boys.
