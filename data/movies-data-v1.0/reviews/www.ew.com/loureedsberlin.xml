      <text>In a performance filmed in Brooklyn in 2006, Lou Reed  gives his 1973 drugs-and-suicide-and-domestic-breakdown album Berlin  the classic-rock treatment (horns, teen choir, Antony  on vocals). Yet this luminously shot concert movie, directed by Julian Schnabel  (who does with film stocks and video images created by his daughter what he used to do with plates), reveals that Berlin  is far from the lost masterpiece the movie wants it to be. Reed and the band get a momentum going in ''Men of Good Fortune'' and the great girl-group bop ''Caroline Says I,'' but as the relationship chronicled by the songs withers, so does the music's majesty.
