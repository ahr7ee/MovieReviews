      <text>One man (Daniel London) faces impending fatherhood, the other (Will Oldham) still clings to a notion of carefree, unencumbered drift. And what begins for these two longtime pals as a weekend mountain camping trip becomes in Old Joy , filmmaker Kelly Reichardt's shimmering, quiet treasure of a film, an elegy to mutable friendship, enduring nature, and the sense of loss that inevitably accompanies the adult pull to move forward. It's in all the moments where little happens that Reichardt is most amazing, investing even a gas-station pit stop with perfect emotional pitch.
