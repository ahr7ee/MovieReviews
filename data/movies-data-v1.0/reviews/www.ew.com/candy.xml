      <text>A really attractive artist (A Good Year ’s Abbie Cornish) loves a really attractive poet (Heath Ledger, pictured with Cornish), which is a good thing in Candy , a wildly romanticized Australian druggie drama. Except they both love heroin, which is a bad thing &#151; and not exactly a new druggie-drama notion. Plus, even as they spiral inevitably downward from ecstasy to hell &#151; she turns tricks, he steals &#151; they somehow still look really attractive, which is a ridiculous thing. Geoffrey Rush, a friend of director Neil Armfield, contributes a flourish as the couple’s enabler.
