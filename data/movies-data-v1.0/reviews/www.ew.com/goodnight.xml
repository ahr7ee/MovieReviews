      <text>Martin Freeman, from the BBC's The Office , has just the right semi-stunned mug to play a guy sliding into work-and-love loserdom who finds solace from his undermining girlfriend with a dream woman he encounters in his sleep. The Good Night  doesn't quite comfortably synthesize all the notions writer-director Jake Paltrow wants to play with in his feature debut. But the filmmaker's got good taste &#151; and luck &#151; in casting. Sister Gwyneth gets therapeutically hard-ass in the dark-haired role of the bad GF, while Pen√©lope Cruz coos and smolders appropriately as the fantasy femme.
