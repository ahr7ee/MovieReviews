      <text>Director Justin Lin had the good idea of making a movie about the search for an actor to replace Bruce Lee after he died, in 1973, partway through the shooting of Game of Death . Lin then had the very bad idea to stage Finishing the Game  as a broad mockumentary, full of tiresomely exaggerated, vainly leering actors with names like Breeze Loo and Troy Poon; they make the contestants on your average reality-dating show look droll. The film completely misses what should have been its real target &#151; the filming of Game of Death , a martial-arts campfest worthy of Edward D. Wood Jr.
