      <text>Horse love and daddy love are the purest loves of all, and Flicka , a new yet insistently old-fashioned spin on the kid-lit classic My Friend Flicka , traffics in both. But bighearted and beautifully shot as it is, this latest film version (the original starred Roddy McDowall, the Alison Lohman of 1943, as the misfit trainer of a ''loco'' horse) can't buck its public-library mustiness, despite a blaring pop/country soundtrack. As for our heroine (Lohman), her archetypal struggle with crusty Pa (uncrusty Tim McGraw) feels attitude-heavy and life-lesson-light.
