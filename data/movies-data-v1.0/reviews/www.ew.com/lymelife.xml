      <text>Nearly three decades after Ordinary People , Timothy Hutton is back for more sadness &#8232;in the 1970s suburbs in Lymelife . In this overworked &#8232;if heartfelt indie, Hutton broods in his &#8232;basement as a distant dad whose vague, unchecked symptoms of debilitating Lyme disease (contracted on tick-infested Long Island) symbolize the vague, unchecked anomie of the era. (Just a guess.) Rory Culkin commands attention, though, as the teen boy next door, negotiating the usual sad-suburbs terrors of first love and tension between his squabbling parents, played by Long Island-bred Alec Baldwin (who also produced) and Jill Hennessy.
