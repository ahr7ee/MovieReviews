      <text>In 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel &#151; it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family (Shue was one of the producers), tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for Heather Graham-cute Gracie (Carly Schroeder) to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie  as processed as an after-school special? You miss the knockabout edge of Bend It Like Beckham  &#151; though the ending, in its Pavlovian sports-flick way, pumps you up.
