      <text>There's no way Hounddog  ain't a greasy gumbo of a mellerdrammer (sorry for the language, that's just the effect of too much Southern Gothic cliché gettin' to me). &#8232; But Deborah Kampmeier's pulp fiction &#151; about a country girly devoted to the music of Elvis Presley in a 1950s backwoods located somewhere near Tennessee Williamsland &#151; might have stood a shot at being judged on its own Black Snake Moan  terms had it starred some interesting, unknown girl, and not the famous young phenom Dakota Fanning.&#8232; Then again, would this arthouse goo have gotten made if Fanning's adult team hadn't agreed it was a fine idea to let their champ wiggle in her underpants?
As it is, Hounddog  is destined to be &#8232;described in shorthand, now and forever, as the one where Dakota Fanning Gets Raped. Even so, that violence is only a small, &#8232; relatively tastefully handled episode in a drama heaped with clichés like...like a big ol' plate of grits. Here, in one swamp, is a drunk, brain-damaged Daddy (David Morse); a twisted, sin-patrolling Granny (Piper Laurie); &#8232;a battered, sad, sexy lady (Robin Wright Penn), a Wise Black Man (Afemo Omilami) who&#8232; teaches our heroine about the real, black man's blues music (none of this Elvis hooey);&#8232; and lots of snakes. Under the circumstances, Fanning is remarkably collected and even dignified. As for the rest of the gang,&#8232; they ought to be returned to sender.
