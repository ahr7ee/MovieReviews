      <text>Has Dennis Quaid really never played a college football coach before? With his handsome, craggy face and likable intensity, he was born for the job, and he's the main attraction in The Express , an overlong 1960s-set biopic of Ernie Davis (Rob Brown), the famous Syracuse running back coached by Quaid's gruff (but kinda soft) Ben Schwartzwalder. The movie is structured all wrong &#151; after the climactic Big Game, it rolls on for another 20 minutes &#151; but Quaid delivers near the end. When Davis becomes the first African- American to win the Heisman, Quaid's choked-up reaction is the movie's high point. Even though it shouldn't be. Bâ€“
