      <text>A deliriously, defiantly unfocused headrush, Stick It  is primarily an exercise in exercise. It's a sports movie that rather hates its sport gymnastics and mercilessly claws at its hidebound conventions, even as the camera lovingly, lavishly music-videos every vault, every layout, every straining sinew. ''Love the gymnast, hate the gymnastics'' seems to be the message. Our very ripped heroine is Haley (Missy Peregrym), a troubled former tumbler well on her way to sanitized Disney delinquency (property damage, black T-shirts) until she's forced to train under a flinty coach (Jeff Bridges). In a thrilling if wholly unearned twist, Haley teaches her fellow leotards that individuality trumps conformity. But Stick It  is written and directed by Bring It On  scribe Jessica Bendinger, so really, sass trumps everything.
