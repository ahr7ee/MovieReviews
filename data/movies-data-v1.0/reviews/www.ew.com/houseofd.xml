      <text>The Women's House of Detention in New York's Greenwich Village, an urban prison that did a brisk business locking up hookers, was torn down years ago, the land raked and planted to create the verdant community garden that blooms today. But the nostalgic memory of a lovably raggedy Village in Manhattan's roughrider 1970s colors House of D , an overly picaresque first feature written and directed by David Duchovny, who also co-stars. The former X-File r is himself a kind of Davey From the Block who grew up within littering distance of the landmark slammer, and he fills his coming-of-age melodrama, told in flashback, with purple flights of raised-in-the-hood fancy &#151; the script is more of a florid novella than a cinematic drama.
Duchovny plays Tom Warshaw, an expat artist living in Paris married to a French beauty and father to a 13-year-old son. The adult Tom looks back to the 13-year-old boy he himself once was (played with sincerity by Hearts in Atlantis ' Anton Yelchin), then living with an emotionally unstable mother (TÃ©a Leoni), hanging around with his best friend (more on him in a moment), and turning for comfort to the tough wisdom offered by a nameless inmate (singer Erykah Badu) through a prison window.
Tom's friend in House of D , I squirm to report, is a janitor named Pappass, self-described (in the movie's pre-PC 1970s lingo) as retarded. The friend, I cringe to explain, is played by Robin Williams, who jokes and cries while wearing prosthetic teeth that shape his mouth into a rictus smile out of a Wallace &amp; Gromit  cartoon. This information is offered for the benefit of those wagering which version of the Williams persona appears: It's the soppy-simpleton one.
