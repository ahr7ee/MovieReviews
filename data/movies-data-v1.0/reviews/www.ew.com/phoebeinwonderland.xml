      <text>As the gifted and troubled Phoebe, who lands the lead role in her grade-school production of Alice in Wonderland , Elle Fanning proves as coyly precocious as her older sister, Dakota &#151; that is, she's charming and annoying at the same time. Phoebe appears to have obsessive-compulsive disorder (or something), but Phoebe in Wonderland  is so intent on celebrating her as ''special'' that it quirks up the trauma of her issues. As the school drama teacher who tries to unlock ''the real,'' Patricia Clarkson makes high theatrical solemnity funny.
