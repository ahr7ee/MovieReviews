      <text>Masculine complexity is what Mads Mikkelsen was famous for long before he wept blood in Casino Royale . In After the Wedding , he plays a Danish orphanage worker in India, summoned home to receive a large donation &#151; with considerable strings &#151; from a benefactor (Rolf Lassgard) married to a beauty (Sidse Babett Knudsen) with a complicated past. Talented filmmaker Susanne Bier (Brothers ), armed with an outstanding compositional sense, keeps control over the storms of melodrama that swirl in this rich weepie, a 2006 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film.
