      <text>Can I be adopted by the Whitfields? Everyone in this madly good-looking clan has got soapy problems as befits an aspirational, say-amen holiday movie. But reunite the family This Christmas  in the big, beautiful L.A. house of the indefatigable matriarch known as Ma' Dere and it's all good. Mostly because the cast is such a powerhouse group, beginning with a blazing Loretta Devine (Grey's Anatomy ) as Ma' Dere, Delroy Lindo as her man, The Wire 's Idris Elba as prodigal eldest son, and the great Regina King (24 ) as bossy oldest sister.
