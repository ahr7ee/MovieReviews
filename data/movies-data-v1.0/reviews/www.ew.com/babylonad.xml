      <text>Even before Babylon A.D. 's release, director Mathieu Kassovitz publicly disowned the sci-fi thriller about a mercenary (Vin Diesel , asleep at the wheel) who is hired to transport a young woman (MÃ©lanie Thierry) from a convent in Kazakhstan to New York City. But it would've been gutsier to take full credit for something this derivative. Babylon 's plot is a lumpy mixture of The Fifth Element   and Children of Men  , while its dystopian future references Blade Runner  , Dune  , and The Matrix  . And when martial arts star Michelle Yeoh  shows up as a butt-kicking nun, you have to wonder if Kassovitz isn't accidentally cribbing from Mel Brooks , too.
