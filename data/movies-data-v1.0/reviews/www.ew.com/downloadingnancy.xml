      <text>An incest survivor (Maria Bello) acts out her damage by hooking up, via the Internet, with a man she asks to hurt her...and worse. Jason Patric plays the creep in question, and Rufus Sewell is cast against type as her boring, clueless husband. Shot in a chilly, desaturated palette, Downloading Nancy  declares, in every frame, that we're in a world without love, faith, joy, or connection. There are brutal scenes with razor blades and other impromptu devices of erotic torment, but what makes the movie a trial to sit through isn't just the heroine's pain-freak tastes. It's that a kinkfest with this blah an emotional spectrum is selling its own chic form of puritanism &#151; sex with all the life force repressed. Câ€“
