      <text>If anything, it was wilder than you thought. A dozen or so witnesses testify, with a lusty nostalgia that shades into older-and-wiser gravity, to the glories and perils of anonymous gay sex during the one decade when people didn't feel guilty about it. The era that ended in 1981, with the onslaught of AIDS, is recalled, variously, as a utopian orgy; a rare time of communal connection; and the most extreme bacchanalia since the fall of Rome. In Gay Sex in the 70s  we hear tales of young men groping their way through spaces so dark they couldn't see their partners, of hookups spurred by a smile on the street. The director, Joseph Lovett, wants us to ask if there's such a thing as too much freedom, and he has the sobriety to say yes &#151; and no.
