      <text>Three brainy chimpanzees are sent on an intergalactic test flight by scientists too daft to realize the primates are actually smarter than they are. What starts as a simian spin on The Right Stuff   becomes a monkey-brained space odyssey as the apes fight to save an alien world from a despot who looks like the love child of a Teletubby  and the monster from Cloverfield  . While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids, Space Chimps  has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar -given knowledge that CGI can entertain &#151; and not just stupefy &#151; moviegoers of any age.
