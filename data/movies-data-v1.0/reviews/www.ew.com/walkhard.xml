      <text>Walk Hard , a parody of warts-and-all pop-star biopics, comes out of the Judd Apatow factory (he produced and co-wrote it), and at first it appears to be nothing more or less than this year's model of Epic Movie, Not Another Teen Movie , and all those other happy-idiot genre spoofs that descend from the Airplane!  school of artfully hyperbolic razzing. Directed by Jake Kasdan, the movie tells the story of Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly), a doltish country-rocker who becomes a star, meets a stage partner (sparkly Jenna Fischer) as prudish as a nun, and enjoys a rise to legend status matched only by his druggy, Daddy didn't love me!  fall. A handful of the jokes score (the boy Dewey slicing his brother in half, which inspires his dad's refrain of ''The wrong kid died!''), a few fall flat (a not-dirty-enough tweak of dirty dancing), and most are mildly clever enough to keep you grinning.
The movie walks the line of surreal vulgarity (you will not, repeat not , expect the penis), yet most of it, intentionally, is less nutzoid than your average megaplex genre parody. It's a teensy bit straighter , and that's a good thing, since it allows Kasdan to take on not just the clich√©s of the biopic but the emotions as well. He skewers the spirit of rock history. As Dewey moves into the hippie '60s, then the variety-show '70s, Reilly lends his weariness a goofy heart. Walk Hard  isn't merciless (except for maybe one wicked sequence with the Beatles), and that's because it so loves what it's sending up: the pleasure, ego, and sheer exhaustion of what happens behind the music.
