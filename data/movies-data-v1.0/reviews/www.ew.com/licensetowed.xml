      <text>Robin Williams, as License to Wed 's mischievous Reverend Frank, could have used a few more of the sort of zingers he had in Mrs. Doubtfire . Reverend Frank refuses to marry Ben (John Krasinski) and Sadie (Mandy Moore), a pair of ''men are from the flat screen TV department'' /''women are from the wedding boutique''  clich√©s, until they undergo his ''program,'' a series of tests designed to  reveal the awfulness they're in for. The creepy-faced robot twin babies are funny (for a while); the rest of the film is not. It's like Meet the Parents  with Dr. Phil as the officiant from hell.
