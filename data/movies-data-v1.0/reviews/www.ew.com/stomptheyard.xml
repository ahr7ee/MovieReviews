      <text>The latest arcane, MTV-icized group activity to receive the loud, busy, generic music-video treatment is stepping, a choreographic tradition of Greek campus life at black universities. In Stomp the Yard , one handsome former L.A. tough (Columbus Short) finds his feet &#151; and a welcome reason to take off his shirt &#151; among other similarly shirtless-worthy Atlanta fraternity brothers. The shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot don't mean a thing. But the stepping does got that swing.
