      <text>Or, Napoleon Not-So-Dynamite . Made in New Zealand, which ups the whimsical-yuk factor because of those funny accents, Eagle vs Shark  is the coy and coyer comedy of a cartoon-passive geek (Loren Horsley) who falls for a cartoon-angry dork with Mick Jagger's lips. He's played by Jemaine Clement (of HBO's Flight of the Conchords ), who has genuine presence but, in this film, only one note to play. Before Clement gives in to romance, he must take revenge on the bully who once beat him up. It's a tale that reduces angst, not to mention love, to a generational tic.
