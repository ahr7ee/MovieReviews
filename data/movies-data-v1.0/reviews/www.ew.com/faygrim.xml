      <text>At first, it looks as though Hal Hartley, that quirky/annoying maestro of the put-on pens√©e , has finally entered the real world. In Fay Grim , his continuation of Henry Fool  (1998), Parker Posey's Fay, estranged wife of the gloomy, drunken bohemian nihilist Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), is arm-twisted by the CIA into locating his confessional notebooks. The tomes may contain scandalous political secrets, but don't be fooled: The faux espionage plot, with its winks at terrorism, is really just a convoluted plea for the relevance of precious indie artistes (i.e., Hal Hartley).
