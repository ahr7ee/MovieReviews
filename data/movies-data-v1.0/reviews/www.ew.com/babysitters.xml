      <text>The premise is out of '70s porn, and so is the overbroad satire and almost total lack of conviction. Katherine Waterston, who's like a bookish Juliette Lewis, plays a teenage wallflower who starts to sleep with the man she's babysitting for (John Leguizamo). Blink and you'll miss the moment she morphs into a heartless pimp-madam, organizing the local Heathers into a ring of babysitter hookers. Director David Ross one-dimensionalizes the girls (they're capitalist vamps) and makes the men victims. He should have called this The Stepford Sluts .
