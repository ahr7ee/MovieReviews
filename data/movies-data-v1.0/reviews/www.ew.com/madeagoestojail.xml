      <text>As long as Madea, the primly old-fashioned yet fearlessly badass matriarch, is shooting off her machine-gun mouth, Tyler Perry 's latest soul operetta lives up to the mischief promised by its title. But that isn't nearly enough of the time. Most of Madea Goes to Jail  is devoted to the weary, mirthless saga of an attorney (Derek Luke ) out to save a former college chum who is now a prostitute (Keshia Knight Pulliam , all grown up from The Cosby Show  ) as he swats away the objections of his upscale fianc√©e (Ion Overman). It's a tale soggy with the kind of race/class lessons that Madea, the director-star's battle-ax alter ego, doles out far more handily (and entertainingly) in a single church-lady-from-hell zinger.
