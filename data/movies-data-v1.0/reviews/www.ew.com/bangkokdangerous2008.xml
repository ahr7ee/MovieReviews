      <text>''My name is Joe,'' says the familiar droopy voice on the soundtrack. ''And this is what I do.'' He's making reference to being a hitman, but the actor might as well be talking about himself: His name is Nicolas Cage , and this is what he does &#151; take the big bucks to star in slovenly, inert pulp of the sort no actor of his magnitude should be stooping to. In Bangkok Dangerous , the Pang brothers, remaking their 1999 Thai thriller, turn Cage into a scruffy, blank-eyed cipher of an assassin, who has been hired to kill four men; we learn so little about them that they flash by like the bad guys in a trailer. The filmmakers even manage to turn seamy Bangkok into the least exotic setting imaginable.
