      <text>In the '80s, if you went to see a jovial piece of horndogus comedicus  like Losin' It  or License to Drive , it was product, pure and simple. In our era, films like Road Trip  or the new Sex Drive  filter their leering, gross-out, smash-and-grab antics through a scrim of nostalgia. You're no longer just watching raunchy teen trash &#151; you're watching an affectionate homage to the raunchy teen trash of yesteryear.

When Ian (Josh Zuckerman), a virgin who thinks he’s met the online hookup of his dreams, jumps into his brother’s 1969 GTO to drive from Chicago to Knoxville, he and his pals &#151; Felicia (Amanda Crew), whom he secretly adores, and Lance (Clark Duke), who adores himself &#151; undergo a set of escapades that run from the sleazy to the sick.
Lance, played with a spew of attitude by newcomer Duke (who could be a baby member of Weezer), finds a few girls of his own, one with a scatological fetish. The sheer pileup of boner gags and the use of a certain three-letter gay slur &#151; I don't even like printing the word, but it's now woefully routine in youth comedy &#151; is relentless.
