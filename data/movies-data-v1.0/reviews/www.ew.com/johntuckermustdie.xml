      <text>You'd think, with a movie called John Tucker Must Die , that the high school basketball stud of the title (Jesse Metcalfe) had done something wrong. Ostensibly, he's been caught dating three pretty girls at the same time, but, really, is that a big deal? Well, no, according to this confused female-disempowerment flick. The trio &#151; assisted by a cherubic Brittany Snow &#151; plot delicious revenges on handsome John. But  astonishingly (and offensively), the witless ending comes down harder on the women than the cad.
