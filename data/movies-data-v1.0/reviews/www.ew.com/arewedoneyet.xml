      <text>In the atrocious sequel to Are We There Yet? , newly domesticated Nick (Ice Cube) falls off a ladder, the porch, and the second story of his dream house. Moving into a crumbling manse in the country, he jousts with a chipmunk, a raccoon, bats, his oblivious wife, his two unpleasant stepkids, and his nutball contractor (an overcaffeinated John C. McGinley). In no time, Nick is a man enraged &#151; which is Ice Cube's bag. But he shouldn't be allowed to turn so sour and angry in painfully inane family comedies, because here he's moderately terrifying.
