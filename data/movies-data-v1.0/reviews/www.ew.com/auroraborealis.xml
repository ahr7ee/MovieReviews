      <text>On paper, Dawson's Creek 's Joshua Jackson and Natural Born Killers ' Juliette Lewis are an unlikely romantic combo. Aurora Borealis  is a piffling indie drama about a Minneapolis guy with an ailing grandpa and the effervescent home aide who tries to snap him out of his local rut, but somehow, Jackson and Lewis are paired persuasively. Lewis, in particular, is a charmer; it's a loss that she never became an A-lister. And Jackson is, as always, earnestness itself. The movie would be a quality guilty-gloopy pleasure if it weren't so deadly overlong.
