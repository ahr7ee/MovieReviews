      <text>In the propulsively outlandish thriller Taken   (it's like Paul Schrader's 1979 Hardcore  with no brain and more muscle), Liam Neeson  plays a retired CIA agent out to find his daughter, who has been abducted by an Albanian sex trafficker. Throwing knock-'em-dead punches, Neeson &#151; a hulk with jackknife limbs &#151; makes Jason Bourne look like a man of tired reflexes. He pierces the underworld of sex trafficking so efficiently it's as if he'd set out to nab Osama bin Laden...and found him in 36 hours.
