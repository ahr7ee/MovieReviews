      <text>Luke Wilson, playing that mopey-ironic note he plays so...consistently , portrays a depressed dude in Henry Poole Is Here  who declares that he ''won't be around'' for long. He then discovers that the water stain on the back wall of his new ranch house may be the face of Jesus. (Yes, it bleeds tears.) It's tragic that Mark Pellington, the talented director of The Mothman Prophecies , lost his wife four years ago, but he has made an autobiographical saga of grief that is gooey, ponderous, and maudlin. It's less a tale of religious rebirth than a faith-based Hallmark card.
