      <text>Shelf mold (on a reportedly troubled production completed in 2005) encrusts this &#8232; misshapen adaptation of Spinning Into Butter , and Rebecca Gilman's 1999 play about racism and toxic political correctness at a small Vermont college &#8232;is lumpy enough as it is. A painfully miscast Parker nervously flips her hair and waves her hands, sitcom-style, as a do-gooding dean of students who must face her own prejudices on a campus where all her white colleagues apparently are hypocrites and fools. Williamson plays a local black journalist &#151; all too obviously a minority position in Vermont.
