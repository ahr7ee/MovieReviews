      <text>The Rwandan genocide of 1994 that left nearly a million Tutsi slaughtered surely deserves another good telling even after Hotel Rwanda  and Sometimes in April . And Beyond the Gates , with its lack of sentimentality, its tough criticism of U.N. inaction, and its cast and crew filled out with real survivors, does nicely. John Hurt is magnetic as a Catholic priest running a school where terrified Tutsi have taken refuge, while Hugh Dancy, as a naive teacher, represents white commitment to black Africa at its most impotent and unreliable. Stay for the credits; the coda is powerful.
