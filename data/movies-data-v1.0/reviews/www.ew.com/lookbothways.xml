      <text>Ineffably Australian and intriguingly (rather than  annoyingly) artsy, Look Both Ways  introduces a handful of people gobsmacked by life-changing crises, all of them trying to make sense of responsibility, mortality, and connection. And forging her own new path, animator Sarah Watt makes a delicate, empathetic live-action directorial feature debut: She mixes her media,  returning to animation to express dreams and fantasies while establishing the connection between Meryl (Justine Clarke), an artist, and Nick (William McInnes, Watt's husband), a newspaper photographer.
