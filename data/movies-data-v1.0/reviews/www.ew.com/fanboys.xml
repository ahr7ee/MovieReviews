      <text>Die-hard Star Wars  devotees, circa 1998, embark on a cross-country mission to break into Skywalker Ranch for a guerrilla preview screening of The Phantom Menace  in Fanboys . Real-life fanboys know that the release of this mildly cute, mildly drooly, majorly too late spoof/homage has been delayed for more than two years. And during that time, an Internet-driven argument has raged about whether the final cut would retain a not-at-all-secret subplot involving the terminal illness of one of the Skywalker intruders. This critic says, ''Ick, it's a gummy sentimental intrusion.'' But the tribe spoke, saying, ''Keep it! That's why the break-in is a gallant act!'' We're both right.
