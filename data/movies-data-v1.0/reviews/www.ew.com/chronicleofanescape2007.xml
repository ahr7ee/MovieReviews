      <text>Chronicle of an Escape 's premise may remind you of Sly Stallone's enjoyably preposterous 1981 soccer/incarceration flick, Victory , but this true-story-based movie scores in a different way. Set during the brutal rule of Argentina's junta, the film tracks a young goalkeeper (Rodrigo de la Serna) as he is kidnapped and tortured by fascist goons before making a break for freedom. The result is blessed with great performances; director Israel Adri√°n Caetano lets events speak &#151; and plead and weep &#151; for themselves.
