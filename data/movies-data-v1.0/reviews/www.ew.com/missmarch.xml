      <text>It knocks off the premise of the J. Geils Band hit ''Centerfold'' &#151; a puritanical high school virgin learns that his former squeeze has became a Playboy gatefold girl &#151; but anyone who goes to see Miss March  hoping for a voyeuristic, â€™80-flavored T&amp;A smutfest will be sorely disappointed. Though rated R, the film spends less time leering than it does indulging in poop jokes, epilepsy jokes, and how-violently-can-we-smash-someone-in-the-face jokes. Writer-director-stars Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore, of the Whitest Kids U'Know, here prove the crassest, most maladroit moviemakers you know. Cregger, as the virgin, is merely bland, but Moore, as his porn-minded buddy, tries to capitalize on his resemblance to Jim Carrey by acting like Jim Carrey; it would have helped if he had one-thousandth the talent of Jim Carrey. The film finally lands at the Playboy mansion, where Hugh Hefner appears as himself &#151; a lot less spryly than he did in The House Bunny .
