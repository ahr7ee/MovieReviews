      <text>How cold is it in Antarctica? Cold enough for hands to freeze &#151; but lips to remain kissing soft. Or at least that's the bad news/good news for Kate Beckinsale as a comely U.S. marshal at an ice-encrusted American research station, investigating a homicide when not battling flashbacks of Something Bad that once happened to her in Miami. Whiteout  is a conventionally jam-packed, dutifully ludicrous action thriller, based on a graphic novel, which features the lithe marshal in a steamy shower and a chase scene in zero-degree visibility (the bad guy wields a scary pickax). As a bonus, a team of screenwriters devised a prologue involving those sturdiest of menaces &#151; 1950s-style Russians swigging vodka. Ah, but are they merely red herrings?
