      <text>The terrier Rexxx might be the least appealing mutt ever to slobber on screen. He's a stuck-up movie-star dog (despite the abundance of X's in his name, he's not that  kind of movie star) who falls out of a plane and becomes a stuck-up rescue dog. Rexxx is cute when he puts on sunglasses. Otherwise, he looks like a cross between a rat and a llama. And he burps, farts, and even poops on dinner. Dog lovers will actually feel sorry for Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia ), the kid who's stuck with him.
