      <text>Have you ever watched Ashton Kutcher boom through his Punk'd  intros and thought, That guy should hurry up and get himself a cartoon voice gig? He does cute, jacked-up work in Open Season  as a broken-antlered buck named Elliot, who helps Boog (Martin Lawrence), a house-trained grizzly banished to the forest, get back to his mountain town. Yet aside from Kutcher and the movie's comfy autumnal palette (its browny reds and light greens), the overfamiliar Open Season  feels like just another CG 'toon in our 'toon-glutted times.
