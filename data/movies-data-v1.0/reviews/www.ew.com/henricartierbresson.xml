      <text>He rarely allowed himself to be interviewed, but Henri Cartier-Bresson, here nearing 100, comes off as a marvelous, spritely, and companionable figure in Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye . With eyes that glow like Yoda's, and a bald head that recalls his fellow humanistic giants Jean Renoir and Henry Miller, Cartier-Bresson, arguably the most influential photographer who ever lived, recalls how he caught, over and over again, the Moment. His work is really a series of global verit√© portraits &#151; of leisure and war, of celebrity and daily life &#151; that he somehow memorialized with a light and compositional richness to rival Rembrandt. The Impassioned Eye  makes that genius disarmingly accessible.
