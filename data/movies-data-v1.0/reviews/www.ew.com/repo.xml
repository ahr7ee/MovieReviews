      <text>Spy Kids ' Vega plays a bedridden teen unaware that her creepily doting father (Anthony Stewart Head) spends evenings messily ''repossessing'' organs at the behest of biotech mogul Sorvino in Repo! The Genetic Opera . And it's an opera. Cue Paris Hilton, industrial-rock din, spinal extractions, Victorian furnishings (velvet curtains, bustiers, birdcages), soprano Sarah Brightman, and the nihilism and desaturated colors of post-Seven horror films. If steampunk bloodbaths aren't for you, it's a long wait for the fat lady to sing.
