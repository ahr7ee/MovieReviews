      <text>Why was Mumble the emperor penguin (Elijah Wood) born to tap-dance rather than sing like the rest of his ilk in Happy Feet , a moderately adorable, musically wacky, ecologically activist CG family comedy from George Miller, the guy who made Babe ? Because Mumble is, you know, different but special in a March of the Penguins  kind of way. Why was Robin Williams hired to voice two ethnic-accented fellow birds? Because once he kibitzed as a genie in Aladdin , and now, alas, he canâ€™t be stuffed back into the freaking lamp.
