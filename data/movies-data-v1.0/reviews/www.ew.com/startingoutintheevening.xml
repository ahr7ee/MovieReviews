      <text>As Leonard Schiller, a once-revered, now quasi-forgotten literary lion of the Upper West Side, Frank Langella gives a performance that is so layered with mourning and wit and experience that, for once, an acting-showcase movie lives up to its promise. Schiller is measuring out his life in typewriter strokes when a brilliant, adoring graduate student (Lauren Ambrose) enters his world. Their relationship flirts with sex, but it's so much more. Andrew Wagner has made a lovely comedy of death and rebirth.
