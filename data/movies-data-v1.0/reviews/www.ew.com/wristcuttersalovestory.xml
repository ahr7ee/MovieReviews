      <text>The afterlife for those who refer to themselves as ''offed'' is a washed-out, dusty road to a SoCal nowhere in Wristcutters: A Love Story , a singular absurdist lark. But the residents are irresistibly hip, beginning with Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous ) as the title suicide, and not limited to Tom Waits as the crackpot leader of a utopian community &#151; utopian at least by suicide standards. The whole film is cracked, but in a stylish, downtown way. And there's a tonic appearance by Arrested Development 's Will Arnett as...a (or is it the?) messiah. Heaven.
