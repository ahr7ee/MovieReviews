      <text>Colin Hanks plays nerdy psycho Doug, a stalker with electronic-eavesdropping savvy, and Ana Claudia Talanc√≥n is Doug's lithe stalkee, Amy, in Alone With Her , Eric Nicholas' intriguing creepout. The agreeably twisted exercise in hidden-camera POV is ultimately more interesting than the relentless stalking itself. The zipper-edged view from Doug's gym-bag cam is particularly snazzy, as are ''found'' visual moments (carefully culled by DP Nathan Wilson), in a Blair Witch Project  for the new, surveillance-obsessed millennium.
