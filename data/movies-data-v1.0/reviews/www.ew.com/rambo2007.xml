      <text>So how does a broody Vietnam vet with a long-term case of post-traumatic stress disorder keep busy in the backwaters of Thailand for 20 years between Rambo III    and the sequel called just plain Rambo ? Judging from the appearance of Sylvester Stallone, who co-wrote, directed, and stars in the hell-with-it-all bloody fourth run of the stomping action franchise, John James Rambo at 61 has kept fit via a regular regimen of wrangling poisonous snakes, running a longboat, and keeping his head bandannas clean. Unfortunately, that quiet life is interrupted by a party of howlingly na√Øve Christian missionaries and medics from Colorado who request Rambo's navigational services. The do-gooders are headed upriver to assist ethnic Karen refugees in Burma (apparently no one's told Rambo that the country's called Myanmar now), underdogs who have been fighting a brutal civil war with the ruling military junta for 60 years.
The fools have chosen a profoundly dangerous route, of course, as befits any war pic involving the word ''upriver.'' It's a given that Rambo will initially say no , followed by grrr . Also a given is the capture of the hapless missionaries, the arrival of a search party of colorful mercenaries, and Rambo's mournful decision to blow all of Burma to hell to rescue the hopeless lot of them &#151; mercenaries and missionaries alike. Baby-stabbing, decapitation, gang rape, and rivers of blood: Rambo  is up to its boot tops in numbing violence.
The brutality, tough enough to take, would be intolerable if Stallone didn't toss the movie like a cant-clearing grenade at notions of stay-the-course righteousness (not to mention at the sermonizing of more faith-based agonies staged by Mel Gibson). Rambo  teaches that fighting sucks, good intentions can be futile, and coalitions of the willing are a charade: A man's got to do what a man's got to do. Sometimes that means tying on the old bandanna to hack one's way out of the Hollywood jungle so disorienting to aging action stars.
