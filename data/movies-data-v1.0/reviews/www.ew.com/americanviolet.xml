      <text>An artlessly powerful performance by newcomer Nicole Behaire anchors American Violet , an instructive, sturdily built drama based on a true story worth teaching: In 2001, an African-American single mother in Texas is falsely accused of drug-dealing during a housing-project raid. Pressured to plead guilty in a plea bargain by a racist District Attorney (Oâ€™Keefe), she chooses instead to file a discrimination suit with support from a northerner ACLU lawyer (Nelson) and a local lawyer (Patton). Here's a case of activist screenwriting where didacticism in the defense of justice is no vice.
