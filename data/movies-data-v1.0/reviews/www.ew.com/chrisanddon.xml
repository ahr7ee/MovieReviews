      <text>Chris was British writer Christopher Isherwood, whose Berlin Stories  became the basis for Cabaret ; Don is artist Don Bachardy, more than 30 years Isherwood's junior, who was a teenage movie-star-struck Californian in the early '50s when he met the man who would be his life partner until Isherwood's death in 1986. Their love story was inevitably complicated. And so is the documentary Chris &amp; Don: A Love Story  &#151; not simply a love letter to love &#151; by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara. The work is a reflective hodgepodge of unnervingly ''cute'' animation, reenactments, archival footage, and Bachardy's own reminiscences, spoken in the singular British accent he invented just as he invented his own unorthodox life.
