      <text>Who knew that the breakup of the Soviet bloc would be such a boon to the slasher-film industry? Severance , a British hack-'em-up, might be described as Friday the 13th  with better motivation. Seven employees of a multinational arms company pay a visit to Hungary &#151; and wind up getting picked off, in the woods, by a ghoulish pack of military renegades. The chintzy characters, hair-raising deaths, and one spectacular rocket-launcher joke aren't enough to give Hostel  a run for its blood, but they will keep the desensitized occupied.
