      <text>The truth? Ricky Gervais' jolting philosophical comedy The Invention of Lying  is seriously subversive. What other rom-com would spend so much time making a convincing case that &#8232; belief in an afterlife is a harmless load of bollocks? Much less one starring a radiant Jennifer Garner as a pretty lady looking to marry a pretty man and make pretty children (which theoretically leaves a disappointed Gervais out of the running as a beau)? In a hilariously literal-&#8232;minded society where people can't help but speak the truth, Gervais is the one guy who realizes that lies can be useful. Wait, it's deeper than that: Without lying &#151; or ''making things up,'' if you'd prefer a more uplifting spin &#151; our hero demonstrates that there'd be a lot of hurt, hopeless people on earth, and no good screenplays.
Perhaps only Gervais &#151; the inconvenient-truth teller from the BBC's The Office  and Extras , the dry voice of reason on awards shows &#151; could argue the pros and cons of &#8232; lying so well, attracting a hip cast that includes Rob Lowe, Louis C.K., and Tina Fey &#8232; to back him up. Honesty compels me to say that the tech aspects are often muddy. (Gervais makes a behind-the-camera debut, codirecting and co-writing with newcomer Matthew Robinson.) But the performances are razor sharp. And the ideas in this movie are, no kidding, big.
