      <text>In a sequel that features the original's Channing Tatum only in cameo, a Baltimore teen (Briana Evigan, very winning) enrolls at an arts academy, leaving her street-dancing pals behind. So far, ho hum. But when she decides to form a new crew with her classmates, Step Up 2 the Streets  improves considerably &#151; and it doesn't skimp on cool pretzel moves. Never mind that the movie heedlessly asks you to cheer against the less white, less privileged street kids. (Okay, mind a little.)
