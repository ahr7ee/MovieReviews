      <text>The first, best season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force  &#151; Cartoon Network's late-night slacker burlesque about three Jersey roommates who happen to be sentient food products &#151; was mind-spanking randomness, rooted in faultless character reality. The subsequent seasons have been a descent into synapse-snapping madness. Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters  turns that madness to full-on seizure. The plot can't be summarized: Let's just say that crazy s--- happens, and occasionally, you laugh.
