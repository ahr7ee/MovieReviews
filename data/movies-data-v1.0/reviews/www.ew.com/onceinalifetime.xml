      <text>As irresistibly brash as its unwieldy title, Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos  is the perfect tailgate party for Americans who may not care a dribble about the World Cup &#151; but will after watching this infectiously energetic documentary. As much about the zeitgeist of riotous New York City in the 1970s as it is about the unlikely soccer team (led by the great Pel√©) hustled together by outsize entrepreneurs, it's a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score.
