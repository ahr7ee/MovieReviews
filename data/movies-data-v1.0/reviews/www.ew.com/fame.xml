      <text>NYC high school students sing, dance, emote in acting classes, and otherwise insist that America's got talent, but this unnecessarily tepid, conservative remake of 1980's far more famous and affecting original Fame  suggests otherwise. Why settle for this dull, safe production &#151; at once airbrushed in plot and undisciplined in execution &#151; when you can watch Glee ? The teachers (including original cast member Debbie Allen as school principal) turn out to be the best part of the show. The kids try hard, but mostly look grim while pretending to smile.
