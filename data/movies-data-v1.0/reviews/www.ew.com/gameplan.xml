      <text>Having tamed one muscled man-child (Vin Diesel in The Pacifier ), Disney sets its sights on The Rock. He preens winningly in The Game Plan  as Joe Kingman, a star quarterback with the kind of empty, Sharper Image-bachelor-pad life guys are supposed to crave, then deplore on cue when an adorable child (Madison Pettis) arrives. Said kid is Kingman's daughter (surprise result of some long-forgotten sayonara sex), and, oddly, she's not such a handful. The lesson seems to be, ''Think you can't have it all? You can!'' Which, as we know, is what parenting is all about.
