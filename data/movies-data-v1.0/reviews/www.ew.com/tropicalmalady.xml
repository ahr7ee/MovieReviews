      <text>At first, Apichatpong Weerasethakul's murky art movie Tropical Malady  is about a romance between a young Thai soldier and a country boy. Then the boy disappears &#151; perhaps he has been transformed into a magical beast &#151; and things change for the even more mythic as the soldier pushes into the heart of the jungle in pursuit. There is no loss of art-movie face to be had, I assure you, in admitting difficulty with the filmmaker's intentional tangle of genres as he stakes his story between waking life and legend: It took me two viewings to enjoy the landscape of Weerasethakul's mysterious jungle &#151; so very thick, steamy, and foreign &#151; without wishing for clearer trail markers.
