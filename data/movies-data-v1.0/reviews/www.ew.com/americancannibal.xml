      <text>Reality TV often consists of greasy hybrids &#151; it's The Osbournes  meets Andrew Dice Clay! &#151; and this expos√© of how the reality sausage gets made, is itself less than pure. American Cannibal: The Road to Reality  follows two writers, Gil Ripley and Dave Roberts (if it's possible to be smugly self-deprecating, that's these guys), as they pitch a who-will-lose-his-cherry series called Virgin Territory . (It's currently casting.) The ''documentary'' then turns into a didactic hoax, with a pilot for a Survivor -gone-cannibal show. The writers act shocked at how low they are stooping, but given their desire to write sitcoms, you have to wonder.
