      <text>In Lakeview Terrace , a chain-&#8232;yanking home-invasion thriller, Samuel L. Jackson  operates in two familiar modes: eyeballs-popping and eyelids-narrowing. As Abel, a testy L.A. cop living in an upscale cul-de-sac with two new next-door neighbors he hates (Patrick Wilson  and Kerry Washington ), Jackson spends most of the film peeping over their fence or reacting to &#8232; perceived slights. Although his eyes once again act the bejesus out of the script, the shtick has gotten old: It's like watching dusty, less perfect retakes of his Ezekiel 25:17 speech from Pulp Fiction . Unfortunately, Jackson is the best thing here.&#8232; The rest of Lakeview  is cravenly engineered to make Wilson's squishy liberal hero a man , and the only surprise is that Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men  ) directed it for hire. This time, there's no art to his manipulations of the plot.
