      <text>If good intentions mattered, writer-&#8232;director Brant Sersen's small-town indie about an awkward Seth Meyers look-alike (Thomas Middleditch) falling for a cool, tattooed carny girl (Rachael Taylor) would get an A. But Splinterheads , which aims to be a quirkier Adventureland , never rises above mildly amusing. A supporting cast of oddballs (Jason Mantzoukas' intense magician The Amazing Steve) and a few familiar faces (hey, Lea Thompson!) aren't enough to keep you from forgetting about the movie the second you walk out of the theater.
