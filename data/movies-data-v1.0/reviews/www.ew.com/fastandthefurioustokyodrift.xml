      <text>The third movie in the Bad News Bears  series, a notable turkey, went to Japan. That trip spells certain doom for the Fast and the Furious  franchise as well. Dubbed Tokyo Drift  (but let's call it 3 Fast 3 Furious ), this junker ships Friday Night Lights ' Lucas Black abroad as punishment (to Tokyo? Lucky jackass!) after he hot-rods through a Phoenix housing development to the tune of that blasted Kid Rock ''Bawitdaba'' song. Once overseas, he tries ''drifting,'' a wavy, tractionless, sorta psychedelic, poky race style whose poorly shot appeal gets lost in translation.
