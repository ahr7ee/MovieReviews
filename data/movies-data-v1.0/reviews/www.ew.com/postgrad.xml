      <text>In Post Grad , the Gilmore Girls  ' bright-eyed Alexis Bledel  plays a Ms. Sunshine who's fresh out of college and unable to find work (let alone her dream job in publishing), and thus &#151; conveniently for the uninspired makers of this dismayingly conservative dramedy &#151; she's temporarily bunking back home with her wacky-lite family. (Carol Burnett  fills the crackpot oldie role usually offered to Alan Arkin.) Friday Night Lights ' Zach Gilford  has the dull honor of playing a loving guy waiting to be loved back. More laziness: Life in the publishing biz is depicted, natch, as a soul suck.
