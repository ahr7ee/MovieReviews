      <text>In The Perfect Holiday , Benjamin (Morris Chestnut) is a struggling songwriter and part-time mall Santa; Nancy (the ever-winning Gabrielle Union) is a divorcée whose daughter asks Santa to bring Mom a man. Will they find love for Christmas? Well, duh. So why throw in a bizarre device involving Queen Latifah as a narrating angel and a creepy, sallow Terrence Howard as her adversary? Their A-list names may be a draw, but it's too bad no one thought the endearing performances in this charming (if cliché) family romance would be enough.
