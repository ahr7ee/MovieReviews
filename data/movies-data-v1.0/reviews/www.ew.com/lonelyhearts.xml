      <text>Jared Leto, looking and acting like a scrawny, pimpish Jim Carrey, is Ray, who scams lonely women out of their savings. Salma Hayek, at her most smeary-lipped voluptuous, is his lover, who poses as his sister &#151; until she jealously slaughters his victims. It's  all based on the same case that inspired The Honeymoon Killers , but Lonely Hearts  never locates the key to the killers' bloody bond. Leto and Hayek, though, make their erotic psychohistrionics fun, and John Travolta and James Gandolfini, as cops, work up a dour camaraderie.
