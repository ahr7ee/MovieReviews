      <text>In this oddly Brit-heavy third attempt to &#8232; create another Marvel film franchise, Ray Stevenson (Rome ) takes over as the vengeful Punisher, following Dolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane. Alas, Stevenson doesn't have much to do except look gloomy after accidentally killing an FBI agent &#151; and then deliberately kills about 50 more people. (His character could be called the Not-Much-of-a-Learning-Curveinator.) Meanwhile, Dominic West (The Wire ) plays a facially mutilated Mob boss as if he's in a broad SNL  sketch. On the plus side, Punisher: War Zone  has one of the all-time great &#8232; B-movie last lines: ''Oh, God, now I've got brains splattered all over me!''
