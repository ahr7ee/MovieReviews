      <text>Steve (Bradley Cooper) is a TV cameraman. Mary (Sandra Bullock) is a deranged, chattering woman who throws herself on Steve on their one and only date, then stalks him because she thinks they're meant be together. Oops, sorry, we're not supposed to think of Mary as mentally ill, psychologically unbalanced, or any of those painful things, just full of gumption and sunny determination. But yikes, All About Steve  is a creepy, humiliating ''comedy,'' playing to Bullock's worst instincts for demonstrating the lovability of women who donâ€™t fit in.
