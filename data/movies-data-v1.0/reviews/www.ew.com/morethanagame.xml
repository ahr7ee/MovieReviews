      <text>At this point, I've seen so many rousingly slick cookie-cutter high school sports movies that I have no real desire to see another one. But that's part of the reason I enjoyed More Than a Game . It tells the story of the ''Fab Five,'' the African-American core members of the Fighting Irish basketball team from St. Vincentâ€“St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. Starting in the early 2000s, the team was led to national glory by the young LeBron James. More Than a Game  is a documentary, but it's every inch a triumph-of-the-underdogs fairy tale. Indeed, it's almost funny, at times, to see how many classic Hollywood tropes are replicated, with far more vivid drama, in this expertly edited assemblage of video-shot game footage and hindsight interviews.
There's the day that Dru Joyce III, the team's tiniest member (barely five feet tall), wins a game by shooting seven three-pointers in a row. There's the team's awesome victory streak, which gets interrupted only when the Fab Five grow too cocky. There's the surreal infusion of big-money endorsement deals &#151; &#8232;in high school! &#151; which no one blinked an eye at until James accepted two free jerseys  from a store, at which point he was benched in the middle of a perfect season. The team had to play without him, and guess what happened? (I won't say.) More Than a Game  could be an extended ESPN special, except that what's moving about it isn't the basketball prowess. It's the die-hard camaraderie that undergirded this squad and lifted it to the top.
