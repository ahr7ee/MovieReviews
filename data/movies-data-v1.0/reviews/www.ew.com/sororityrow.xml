      <text>To get revenge on a not-so-nice boy, six sorority sisters decide to trick him into thinking he's accidently killed his ex &#151; until she actually does die when the hoax goes awry. It¹s a horrible prank played by horrible people, which is why you¹re not too upset when a hooded mystery man (or woman) begins killing off the sisters (and a few innocent bystanders) one by one. Snaps to Carrie Fisher for being a good sport, as the sorority¹s badass house mom, but don't rush the theater: The tedious flick offers little more than a few scares, and plenty of boobs. And we're not just talking about the cast.
