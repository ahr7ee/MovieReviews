      <text>Money has little to do with the kind of emotional wealth shared so generously in Been Rich All My Life , Heather Lyn MacDonald's affectionate portrait of the Silver Belles &#151; five uptown knockouts who met as Harlem chorus girls in the 1930s and continue to dance into their 80s and beyond. MacDonald mixes choice footage of the hoofers in their prime with loose on-the-spot scenes of octogenarian dailiness in happy times and sad. Injury, illness, and death make appearances, but these remarkable women never lose their gratitude for where their feet have taken them. Good times and bum times, they've seen it all and they're still here. Lucky us.
