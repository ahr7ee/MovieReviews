      <text>In Seven Pounds , an unintentionally ludicrous drama of repentance as an extreme sport, a humorless, impenetrable Will Smith  plays a guy &#8232;who's really rich, really apologetic about mistakes he's made in the past, and really, by any sane moviegoer's measure, kind of nuts. (He may or may not be an IRS agent; &#8232;he definitely keeps a deadly jellyfish as a pet in his seedy motel room.) Poor Rosario Dawson  looks lovely but lost as a beautiful woman with a real-not-metaphorical &#8232;failing heart; Woody Harrelson  looks ready for an SNL  sketch as a gentle, blind telephone operator and pianist. Do not attempt &#8232;these acts of atonement at home.
