      <text>A bungled drug shipment causes problems for a pack of dim-witted dealers, not to mention the baby-face deliveryman (Scrubs ' Donald Faison) who gets the address wrong in the first place. Aimlessly directed by first-timer Benny Boom, Next Day Air  just plain doesn't work as entertainment &#151; it's too unpleasant to be a comedy and too vapid to be anything else. Even worse, there's something genuinely depressing about the sang-froid it shows towards its cast (which includes Mike Epps and Mos Def), particularly in the gruesome climax with a pointlessly high body count. If the movie doesn't even care about its characters, then how can we?
