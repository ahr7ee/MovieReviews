      <text> “Crossover” is a decent example of Sidekick Cinema: a movie to glance up at from time to time while you download ring tones or text-message your friends. Set in the rough-and-tumble world of Detroit street basketball, it features on-court showdowns you’ll want to keep an eye out for, plus buck-wild cheerleaders so scantily dressed that half the budget must have gone to Brazilian bikini waxing. From the look of the shoddy photography and no-bones production design, I’m not sure what the other half was spent on.  For those paying closer attention, the movie does have a serious moral agenda, albeit one resolved by the laziest of “where are they now” codas. Tech (Anthony Mackie) dreams of N.B.A. stardom while pursuing his G.E.D. His buddy Noah (Wesley Jonathan) is studying hard for medical school. The pursuit of their goals is complicated by a Faustian nightclub owner (Wayne Brady), the local street ball champ (Phillip Champion) and a pair of girlfriends (Alecia Fears and Eva Pigford) conceived of by the writer and director Preston A. Whitmore II as a milquetoast manicurist and a trash-talking gold digger, respectively.  Temptation, striving and rivalry are the keynotes of the movie, which is sincere in debunking the notion that the highest aspiration for a young black man is to be the next Allen Iverson. As for the game play, N.B.A. Street V3 for the Xbox isn’t losing any sleep.  “Crossover” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The language, the attitude and the representation of women come from the street.</text>
