      <text>as Elvis abducted by aliens? Did Hitler flee to South America? Some people are so famous (or infamous) in their lifetimes that we refuse to let them rest in peace. For the French, the circumstances of Napoleon Bonaparte's death in 1821 on the island of St. Helena conjure the same tantalizing fantasy of a demigod who will not die. "Monsieur N," Antoine de Caunes's densely plotted costume drama, suggests that Napoleon's demise might have been an elaborate hoax through which he escaped into anonymity. It's not the first movie to make such a proposal. "The Emperor's New Clothes" (with Ian Holm as Napoleon) offered a variation of the same notion. The heart of the movie, which flashes back from Paris in 1840, when Napoleon's body was exhumed and returned to Paris, to his final years in exile, is set on the bleak, windswept island in the south Atlantic. Contrary to what you might have assumed from high school history books, the emperor (Philippe Torreton) wasn't simply cast away on a rock and left to fend for himself. He was guarded by 3,000 British soldiers, 1,000 of whom kept watch over his residence at Longwood House. A flotilla of battleships patrolled the island, where he was attended in the imperial manner by the remnants of his loyal staff, among them Mar�chal Bertrand (Roschdy Zem), Generals Montholon (St�phane Freiss) and Gourgaud (Fr�d�ric Pierrot) and their families; his butler, Cipriani (Bruno Putzulu); and his manservant, Ali (Igor Skreblin). The cost of his imprisonment in the royal style to which he was accustomed was a major financial headache to the British, who desperately tried to impose budgetary restraints. "Monsieur N" is narrated by Basil Heathcote (Jay Rodan), a young lieutenant assigned as a liaison between the emperor's staff, and Sir Hudson Lowe (Richard E. Grant), the British governor in charge of the island. The role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's, inspires Mr. Grant to strut his nastiest stuff as the most officious martinet ever to burst buttons on his uniform, preening and fuming in full Type-A mode. Before settling in to contemplate Napoleon's escape plan, which is presented as his ultimate strategic coup, the movie offers a heady dose of life on St. Helena, where the food and wine (imported by supply ship) are excellent but the boredom suffocating. While Napoleon dictates his memoirs to the toadying Montholon, Montholon's wife, Albine (Elsa Zylberstein), works overtime as the emperor's mistress (with her husband's approval.) Like everyone else on St. Helena, the couple is scheming to be left a hunk Napoleon's fortune. The arrival of Betsy Balcombe, (Siobhan Hewlett), a young English rose who throws herself at the emperor, threatens to derail the Montholons' plans. The film's vision of the exiled court consumed by spying, gossiping and jockeying for position presents a deliciously cold-eyed view of power and sycophancy. Napoleon may be an egomaniac, but he is a ruthless truth-teller who sees through every ploy and blandishment. Ren� Manzor's screenplay is peppered with the emperor's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as easily the smartest person in the room: "History belongs to those who tell it"; "Truth and history are poor bedfellows"; "Men will sacrifice reason to their imagination"; "Love doesn't lie in the past or the future, but in the present." He drives Betsy to tears with his warning, "There's no love in my bed, just favors and bills of exchange." Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor, one of the most compelling Napoleons ever imagined for the screen, exerts a magnetic, if slightly repellent spell. The actor's brooding glances and blunt remarks signal a tactical genius as aware of his impending mortality as he is of his addiction to power. Once the emperor's health deteriorates and he fades from the movie, "Monsieur N" redirects its energy to the escape plot, but it's not nearly as interesting as Mr. Torreton's layered performance. The narrative is complicated by its back-and-forth structure, which eventually turns the movie into an elaborate game of Clue. If it all adds up to too much for one film (even at 127 minutes) to encompass with ease, "Monsieur N," which opens today at Cinema Village in New York, is certainly richer than most of what you'll find on the History Channel.</text>
