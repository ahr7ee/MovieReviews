      <text> Reeking of self-righteousness and moral reprimand, Michael O. Sajbel’s “Ultimate Gift” is a hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox’s new faith-based label, Fox Faith. If the goal is to attract Christian dollars to the multiplex, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of their owners is not the best way to go.  The focus of our learning and growing is Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller), a trust-fund baby who shows up at the funeral of his billionaire grandfather, Red (James Garner), sporting morning-after shades, day-old stubble and a dangling cigarette: the badges, if not the wages, of sin. Before he can get his hands on granddaddy’s money, however, Jason must complete a series of tasks assigned by Red via a videotaped will and designed to teach the value of friendship, love and all the other things we like to believe rich people are lacking. Should Jason’s spirit quail, there’s an adorable, leukemia-stricken child (Abigail Breslin) waiting in the wings with a bottomless supply of homilies. And you thought her performance in “Little Miss Sunshine” was saccharine.  As Jason braves drug runners in Ecuador, and a stint on a Texas ranch laying fence and listening to Patsy Cline (“So this is hell,” he moans), the movie’s messages — pro-poverty, anti-abortion — are methodically hammered home. And while it’s always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, “The Ultimate Gift” is a cinematic sermon that even reprises its bullet points during the end credits. In case anyone is wondering, I totally aced the test afterward.  “The Ultimate Gift” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some bad words, a few bad people and a cattle prod used as a motivational tool.</text>
