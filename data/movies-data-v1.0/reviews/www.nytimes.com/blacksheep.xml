      <text> “It’s an exciting time to be involved in agricultural science.” The achievement of “Black Sheep,” a pastoral horror-comedy from New Zealand, can be measured in its ability to make that sentence sound both sinister and hilarious. The movie is essentially a silly, grisly elaboration of a simple idea: What if sheep started running amok, feasting on human flesh and turning their victims into huge ovine zombies?  To a New Zealander like Jonathan King, who wrote and directed “Black Sheep,” the notion must be especially horrifying, since the people of that country are vastly outnumbered by  kebabs on the hoof. Turning a notoriously docile, none-too-intelligent species into a source of menace is an impressive, if improbable, feat of filmmaking.  Mr. King accomplishes it through the use of gory effects —  the exuberant grotesquerie owes a clear debt to the early work of Peter Jackson —  and through less elaborate means. A single sheep, eerily lighted and accompanied by a jolt of the right music, can be monstrous. A herd thundering over an open hillside is downright apocalyptic.  The monster sheep are the result of genetic engineering gone awry. An ambitious farmer, Angus Oldfield (Peter Feeney), has been working on a super-species, but his plans are disrupted by his estranged brother, Henry (Nathan Meister), and a pair of hapless animal-rights activists (Danielle Mason and Oliver Driver). Because of a childhood trauma Henry suffers from a paralyzing sheep phobia, which the movie does everything in its power to vindicate.  Once you have seen a sheep munching on a bloody human leg, you may think twice about your next leg of lamb. On the other hand maybe you’ll be inspired to seek vengeance. To provoke one of these responses —  vegetarianism or a defiant meat eating —  may be the point of this odd, amusing film.</text>
