      <text> Though the rap-fueled "ATL" is full of untested actors, the most amateurish thing about it, surprisingly, is the script. The cliché-marred story aspires to be a street-cred-level view of hard-luck black teenagers in Atlanta, yet it ends up — as an earlier generation of young people might have said — selling out to the establishment.  But forget the somewhat predictable tale, from a screenplay by Tina Gordon Chism and a story by Antwone Fisher (yes, the "Antwone Fisher" Antwone Fisher). The fun here is in seeing a new batch of rappers try acting, and some of them turn out to be eminently watchable. Tip Harris, better known as the Atlanta rapper T. I., displays a smoldering something-or-other as Rashad, a teenager who after the death of his parents has taken responsibility for raising his younger brother, Ant (played credibly by Evan Ross, son of Diana, in his film debut). And Antwan Andre Patton — Big Boi from OutKast — is very entertaining as the drug dealer who tries to draw Ant into his web.  The action centers on an Atlanta roller-skating rink, and it is here that the director, Chris Robinson, a veteran of music videos, seems most comfortable, creating some great-looking minivideos within the film. But elsewhere his music-video genes undercut the movie. He can't stay with a scene long enough to let his actors build momentum.  As for the story, this almost entirely black film borrows the blueprint from another, very white movie, "American Graffiti": teenagers about to graduate, hanging out at the rink/drag strip, wondering about their futures, hormones surging. If only it could have stayed honest till the end, as the earlier film did, rather than take the upbeat way out.  "ATL" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), mostly for moderately foul language.</text>
