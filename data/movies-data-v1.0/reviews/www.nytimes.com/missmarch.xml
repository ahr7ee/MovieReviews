      <text> This boy-has-girl, boy-won’t sleep-with-girl, boy-falls-into-coma-and-wakes-years-later-to-find-girl-is-Playboy-centerfold comedy is the brainchild of Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore of the television sketch show “The Whitest Kids U’Know.”  The pair wrote, directed and star, playing the odd-couple best friends Eugene (Mr. Cregger), who lectures for Abstinence Now! (before the whole coma thing), and Tucker (Mr. Moore), a hound dog who runs the gamut of emotions from goofy to goofier.  Mr. Cregger and Mr. Moore understand the ABC’s of comic opposites and comedy plotting. After Eugene wakes from his coma, Tucker springs him from the hospital for a road trip. Destination: the Playboy Mansion. (Hugh Hefner plays himself, dispensing this nugget of advice to Tucker: You don’t need to find a bunny; find the bunny that’s in every girl.) And the ending neatly ties up all the plotlines.  The problem with “Miss March” is that it isn’t very funny. There’s much spraying liquid, predictable excrement, a smutty rapper, an epileptic girl and, of course, beautiful lesbians making out. Mostly it all feels tame, right down to the film’s softhearted message of true love. Mr. Moore lacks the acting chops to turn Tucker into the force of anarchic mayhem that the movie needs him to be. Instead he’s just annoying. (Mr. Cregger fares better in the straight-man role.)  And the best line wasn’t in the movie. A young man sitting behind me asked his friend to guess Mr. Hefner’s IQ. (It’s a big number.) The reply:  “It doesn’t really take a high IQ to think that men like seeing naked ladies.”  “Miss March” is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for genitalia jokes, a spastic colon and women’s breasts.</text>
