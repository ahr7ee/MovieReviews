      <text> The synopsis of “The Hammer” makes it sound like a long-lost Billy Crystal movie: a smart-alecky, self-destructive Los Angeles handyman named Jerry Ferro (Adam Carolla) loses his job and his girlfriend, then reconnects with his past as a Golden Gloves boxer and tries to qualify for the United States Olympic team at  40.  Mr. Carolla, an amateur boxer and cable  television veteran, has a tendency to riff when he should be acting,  and the whole project — written by Kevin Hench and directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld (“Kissing Jessica Stein”) — is rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, “The Hammer” also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes.  The hero’s wooing of a public defender (Heather Juergensen), while obligatory, has its charming moments (particularly a flirtatious exchange that employs the Chinese word  chi  as a euphemism).  But in classic sports-movie tradition, the real love story is in  the central male friendship, between Jerry and his chief rival, the younger, more talented  Robert Brown (Harold House Moore). But rather than set  Robert  up as a cardboard nemesis, “The Hammer” has Jerry slowly forge a friendship with him based on competitive drive and grudging mutual respect, then builds it to a payoff that’s as unexpected as it is moving.  “The Hammer” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for brief strong language.</text>
