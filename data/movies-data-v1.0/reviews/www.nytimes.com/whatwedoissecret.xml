      <text> “All I want is beer and damage,” asserts Darby Crash (played by Shane West), the punk-rock flameout and frontman of the Germs, near the beginning of Rodger Grossman’s adoring biopic, “What We Do Is Secret.”  What Crash really wanted, however, was posthumous adulation, and Mr. Grossman does his best to oblige. Focusing on the five years between the singer’s banishment from high school and his heroin-assisted suicide in 1980, the filmmaker sketches a virtually parentless, Nietzsche-reading teenager who forms a band out of boredom and a desire for attention. With fraudulently acquired instruments and a complete lack of musical ability, the Germs would trash Los Angeles stages and endure heckling by other bands before recognizable chords would enter their repertory.  More amusing than tragic in its depiction of the band’s infantile behavior, “What We Do Is Secret” reveals its hero as a disaffected egotist and a magnet for needy weirdoes. Structured around imagined interviews with band members and hangers-on, the movie offers too little of Crash’s justly revered lyricism and too much of his self-mutilation and manufactured chaos.  Despite this — and a particularly ugly dental prosthesis — Mr. West succeeds in conveying the intelligence behind the desperation, exposing an intellect wholly focused on premeditated extinction. His Crash is tormented proof that sustaining a career is a lot tougher than bailing on one.  “What We Do Is Secret” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters shoot up, beat up and heat up.</text>
