      <text> A familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity, Davis Guggenheim’s “Gracie” depicts the obstacles faced by a young girl who dreams of playing on her high school soccer team. Yet the movie’s follow-your-heart simplicity masks deeper concerns; like the recent “Flicka,” this perceptive family drama is really about a daughter’s struggle for her father’s attention.  The sole girl in a soccer-mad family, Grace Bowen (a wonderful Carly Schroeder), 15,  is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked. Her mother (Elisabeth Shue) is overprotective, and her father (Dermot Mulroney) — an ex-player freighted with his own childhood issues — is only interested in training his three sons. When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer.  Set in New Jersey in 1978 and based on events in Ms. Shue’s life, “Gracie” connects the adversity-drama dots — the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter — with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley’s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens.  “Gracie” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Characters fumble the ball and fumble with one another.</text>
