      <text> How cool is Mars? Pretty cool, I guess. Now how about when it's being projected on a 10-story-tall movie screen smack in front of your face? That's a little better, in an eyeball-busting sort of way. Written and directed by George Butler ("Pumping Iron," "The Endurance"), a filmmaker who knows a thing or two about bigness, "Roving Mars" is the latest Imax extravaganza from Walt Disney Pictures.  Propelled by the yo-yo minimalism of another phoned-in Philip Glass score, the movie chronicles the production, launch and triumphant success of Spirit and Opportunity, nicknames for a pair of wildly complex gadgets designed to explore and analyze the Red Planet. Read no more if you want to grow up to be an astronaut; here are 40 minutes of nonstop robots, spaceships and bright-eyed NASA geeks enthusing about tangles of circuitry and nifty hydraulics. Sample line of voice-over: "It's going to another planet for real!"  For the Kennedy Space Center set, "Roving Mars" is sure to prove a rocket-science riot, but others may grow perplexed and dismayed once the journey takes off into space. Computer animation takes over where cameras can't go, so that the whole spectacular Rover adventure ultimately plays like an extravagant cartoon. If many  of the scenes are  fake, however, the thrill of the project is not, and what we do see of the surface — hyperclear photographs on the scale of 100-by-180 feet — is  out of this world.</text>
