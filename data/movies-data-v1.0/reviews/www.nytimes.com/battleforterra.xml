      <text> If you’re making an animated movie about another planet and go to the trouble of doing it in 3-D, shouldn’t you give your extraterrestrial inhabitants an interesting, complex appearance? The beings of Terra, the planet in peril in the 3-D “Battle for Terra,” look a bit like flying spermatozoa. They’re supposed to be lovable — Terra has mastered the art of peaceful, prosperous existence, you see — but in truth they’re kind of creepy.  Anyway, their squiggly paradise is disrupted by the arrival of brutish humans, who are looking for a new home after having destroyed their own through a combination of environmental abuse and war. The human military commander (voice of Brian Cox) is eager to just blast the locals to bits and take over Terra, but one of his fighter pilots (Luke Wilson) starts thinking differently after he crash-lands and is rescued by a girl-squiggle named Mala (Evan Rachel Wood).  The movie’s messages are delivered with a heavy hand, but some of the scenes are eye-popping, especially — sorry, peace-loving Terrians — the battle sequences. The starry voice cast also includes Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover and James Garner.  “Battle for Terra” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) because war, 3-D or otherwise, is a violent business.</text>
