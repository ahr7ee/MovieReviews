      <text> In George Bamber's frothy directorial debut, "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green," it's not the title character's social life that lacks spark, it's Ethan Green (Daniel Letterle) himself. He may get by as the hero of Eric Orner's popular gay-theme comic strip on which the film is based, but here he comes off as whiney, immature and, frankly, quite dull. But livelier supporting characters, notably his peppy mother, Harper (Meredith Baxter, best known for playing a favorite 80's TV moms in "Family Ties"), who works as a gay-and-lesbian wedding planner, and Sunny, a basket case of a real estate agent, make up for some of his shortcomings.  At 26, Ethan Green has no trouble finding a hot guy to date or engage in casual sex with, but he is becoming increasingly tired of cruising the fast lane and leans toward settling down. It will be of very little consequence to audiences whether he ends up with the hunky yet intellectually challenged ex-baseball player, the flirty 19-year-old or the mature ex-boyfriend about to wed an obnoxious Republican. The film seems to know it, thankfully, and flaunts its frivolity aggressively with camp and lewd humor. Yet more often than not, these tactics fall flat, and the mostly unfunny — and unfabulous — trifle never rises above sitcom level. Where's the laugh track when it's needed most?  "The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian)for strong language, sexual content and crude humor.</text>
