      <text>n the new wildly silly action flick "XXX: State of the Union," all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (n� O'Shea Jackson). Having slid, skied and snowboarded into unconscious parody in the first "XXX," a deeply silly movie predicated on the laughable but (who knew?) nonetheless lucrative idea of Vin Diesel as Extreme Bond, the producing team behind this new entertainment has apparently decided that the only place to go with the sequel is over the top - way over the top. And so over the top they all merrily go, on their way to one spectacular splat landing. Ever since Sean Connery hung up his tuxedo and Walther,   after his last outing as James Bond in the early 1980's, filmmakers have tried to refurbish the superspy with new, unimproved weaponry, innumerable gimmicks and vixens. With the exception of the two "Bourne" films, the cinematic results have been generally less than super, largely because the people who make these kinds of movies tend to just pump up the volume and ignore story and character. (British television does much better by spies.) The makers of "State of the Union" subscribe to the Jerry Bruckheimer big-bang theory of action (big, bigger, biggest), but they don't share that maestro's attention to detail, or apparently his deep pockets. The state of this cinematic union is shabby indeed. So is the nitwit story. Ice Cube plays Darius Stone, a former member of the Navy Seals turned special-ops warrior with precisely two expressions: a raised-left-eyebrow sneer and a raised-right-eyebrow sneer. Unjustly imprisoned, Stone is so tough that he even sneers, eyebrows arched with rage or possibly a little gas, when his old boss comes to spring him. The would-be liberator is the National Security Agency contact, Gibbons, who put the first XXX operative through his paces. (Because Mr. Diesel either declined to make the sequel or was forcibly recused, the first agent has since mysteriously expired.) Played by Samuel L. Jackson, doing his familiar tough-guy thing without shame and with no evident enthusiasm, Gibbons tosses Stone back into the fray to put the kibosh on a treasonous plot engineered by the Secretary of Defense (Willem Dafoe). Despite the strenuous efforts of the director, Lee Tamahori, who with "Die Another Day" injected a little oomph into the James Bond franchise, "State of the Union" isn't - surprise, surprise - about fascistic cabinet members, American policies or anything remotely connected to the here and now. It's about bling, boom and boffo box office. It's also about boys and toys, which is fitting, given that the screenwriter, Simon Kinberg, one of Hollywood's newest go-to action guys (one of his gigs is the forthcoming "X-Men" movie), likes to interject cute phrases like "lock and load" and "rap and tap" into his mercilessly bad dialogue. It's also about casting actresses who are easily upstaged by their breasts, and young actors, like Scott Speedman, who look as if they should be warbling in a boy band rather than suiting up for the N.S.A. For his part, Ice Cube looks so sincere, kicking, punching and occasionally struggling through his vigorous paces, that it's a shame no one else in the movie seems similarly engaged. Graced with a moon face and a body that looks reassuringly lived-in, the affable actor has been a welcome presence in movies like "Barbershop," in which he projects a gruff decency at odds with the thug-posturing that defined his early rap persona. (Recently, he even branched out into family fare with the movie "Are We There Yet?") While he gives it his all, Ice Cube never seems like the right man for the job in "State of the Union," even if there is something surreally entertaining about the sight of him going mano � mano with Mr. Dafoe on a speeding presidential bullet train headed straight to, well, you know - home video. "XXX: State of the Union" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes dozens upon dozens of gun deaths, violent hand combat, perilously exposed bosoms and crude adult language.</text>
