      <text> Special effects transform Marlon Wayans into a belligerent midget jewel thief in “Little Man,” but it’s the people behind the camera — the guys who brought you “White Chicks,” as the trailer hideously forebodes — who are responsible for the depressing infantilism.  After nabbing a diamond the size of his fist, Calvin, the thief on the lam, stashes it with a pair of unsuspecting yuppies (Kerry Washington and Shawn Wayans). The plot revolves around his attempts to retrieve it by masquerading as a freakish orphan left on their doorstep, while mostly serving as a pretext for the crotch-level protagonist to abuse men’s testicles and sexually molest women.  Somewhere within all the crude slapstick and crass stereotypes, “Little Man” operates as a vulgar burlesque on the crisis of African-American manhood, particularly the relationships, or lack thereof, between fathers and sons. Not that the Wayans brothers are conscious of anything more than the fortune to be had from defecation set pieces and gay-panic jokes.  Better filmmakers would mine the disreputable vein of humor in the movie’s slyest joke: a black and white police duo discussing the skin color of suspects in terms of the Starbucks drink it most resembles. A more characteristic scene, and one that nicely summarizes what’s in store for the ticket holder, has a dog empty its bladder all over Marlon Wayans’s face.  “Little Man” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Dirty-minded, foulmouthed and covered in excrement.</text>
