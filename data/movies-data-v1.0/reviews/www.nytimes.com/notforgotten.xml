      <text> February 2008: Simon Baker shoots “Not Forgotten.” March 2008: Simon Baker is cast in a new television series called “The Mentalist.” September 2009: “Not Forgotten,” a lurid yet plodding thriller, bobs to the surface in theaters, most likely to the chagrin of the now very hot Simon Baker.  Mr. Baker and Paz Vega star as Jack and Amaya, an inordinately attractive couple living in a town near the Mexico border that is part Mayberry, part freak show. The abduction of their daughter (played by Chloe Moretz) sets in motion a plot full of twists that can be seen coming from some distance; the fact that the kidnapped girl is also the narrator doesn’t increase the suspense.  Eventually Jack heads south of the border to battle mobsters, Mexican folk religion and his own wildly improbable secret past. Mr. Baker works hard, but he doesn’t do back-streets avenger as well as he does smug playboy.  Dror Soref, director and co-writer (with Tomás Romero) of this mishmash of “Touch of Evil” and “Angel Heart,” gooses the atmosphere with strobe-like montages of violence and lingers on the faces of strange-looking passersby. Early on the 11-year-old narrator says, “One day I just stopped caring.” You will, too.  “Not Forgotten” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Semi- nude strippers and prostitutes; violence to people and chickens.</text>
