      <text> The third feature film of the German director Angelina Maccarone, "Unveiled" tells the story of an Iranian translator, Fariba (Jasmin Tabatabai), who flees her homeland after falling in love with a married woman, only to be refused asylum in Germany on the grounds that her persecution is not political in nature. Desperate to avoid repatriation, she takes on the identity of another Iranian refugee, Siamak (Navid Akhavan), who dies just before his request for asylum is granted. Disguised as a man, Fariba takes a job in a cabbage processing plant and embarks on a lonely life in a strange country that is often just as intolerant as the land she has fled. She finds herself drawn to a co-worker, Anne (Anneke Kim Sarnau), who, to her delight, returns her feelings - but in a twist straight out of a Shakespeare comedy, Anne has no idea that the young man she's falling for is actually a woman.  With its deliberately overexposed film stock and driving electronic score, Ms. Maccarone's film occasionally suffers from a self-conscious artiness, but at its center is an extraordinary performance by Ms. Tabatabai as Fariba, a young woman whose expectations have been lowered by a lifetime of systematic mistreatment but who still holds out hope for the possibility of both justice and love.</text>
