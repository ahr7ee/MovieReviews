      <text>chultze Gets the Blues" rediscovers the world through the astonished eyes of a retired German salt miner on a musical pilgrimage to the United States. As the title character (Horst Krause) ambles around the Texas Gulf Coast and Louisiana bayou country, the screen drinks in the sultry, humid atmosphere. Puttering on the local waterways in a battered blue motorboat, using his few words of broken English to communicate, Schultze enjoys a late-life liberation that the movie pushes to the brink of sentimentality. Beer-bellied and taciturn, he is not the kind of tourist who takes aim at a strange location with a guidebook, camera and language tapes in hand. He is more like a benign visitor from another galaxy who has simply dropped out of the sky. The film's contemplation of the wonders of the everyday isn't limited to Schultze's American odyssey. The German director and screenwriter Michael Schorr, in his feature film debut, studies everything in sight from the same childlike perspective. The rituals of Schultze's drab provincial life look just as exotic (though much less pleasurable) as those in the "faraway places with strange-sounding names" (to quote an old Bing Crosby hit) that lure him abroad. As the movie begins, Schultze, who spent his life toiling in a salt mine, is reluctantly pushed into early retirement along with several other miners, including his best friends, J�rgen (Harald Warmbrunn) and Manfred (Karl-Fred M�ller). With nothing much to do, they while away their days drinking beer, fishing, playing cards and squabbling over chess. An amateur accordionist, Schultze belongs to a music club whose members meet regularly to perform the same antique chorales and polkas they have been recycling for decades. At home one afternoon, Schultze's ears perk up at the accordion sounds  of a Texan zydeco band on the radio. He picks up the tune on his instrument and soon becomes obsessed with it. Before long, he is experimenting in his kitchen with Cajun dishes, including a spicy jambalaya that he serves to his delighted friends. Asked to perform at the club's 50th-anniversary celebration, he decides,  after much debate, to play the zydeco tune instead of the expected polka. The performance has a mixed reception. Several stunned  members view his defection as cultural heresy. The club nevertheless decides to send him as its representative to a folk festival in Texas. Once there, he realizes he's musically far outclassed and spends the rest of his stay enjoying a vacation. Because it's a study of late-life angst, "Schultze Gets the Blues" has a distant affinity with the far more articulate "About Schmidt." It is closer in spirit to sweetly humanist cult films like "Bagdad Cafe" that enfold you in a big, reassuring bear hug. It's a good thing the movie has so little dialogue, because when it talks, the words dilute its almost surreal visual spell, and the fructose turns to saccharine. "Schultze Gets the Blues" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has nudity.</text>
