      <text> There’s a refreshing lack of numbers in the title of “Friday the 13th,” the latest in a slasher-flick franchise that has spawned approximately 500 sequels, including one that sent its villain, a hockey-mask-wearing psycho named Jason, into outer space to terrorize nubile astronauts.  Neither is it a remake of the 1980 original, which is just as well, since even that dubious classic is a lousy movie. Directed by Marcus Nispel, who gave us a monstrously cynical remake of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” a few years back, “Friday the 13th” attempts to shake off a quarter-century of Jason-related silliness (“Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan”). Set in the present-day, with a story line that references the original’s mythology, this movie attempts to reboot the concept, if that’s the word, of this undying series.  The surprise is that it does so with vicious aplomb, massacring its generic clutch of topless young girls and their inebriated boyfriends, assembled at a lavish summer house around the way from Camp Crystal Lake, with a gleeful sense of fun.  Fun? Granted, most people’s notion of entertainment doesn’t involve watching sexed-up, beer-guzzling morons impaled, decapitated or burnt alive. But there’s an itch for this kind of material, and here it is scratched — to the bone.  “Friday the 13th” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some very, very nasty things.</text>
