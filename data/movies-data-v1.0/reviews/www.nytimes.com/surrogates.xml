      <text> The nifty premise of “Surrogates” builds on a science-fiction conceit familiar from the likes of the 1973 movie “Westworld” and the online game “Second Life.” In a reality that looks a lot like today’s  (a Prius is the most far-out car), human beings hide away at home,  where, hooked up with electrodes,  they live, work and play through robotic surrogates. Idealized types — which, because this is a Hollywood movie, means a lot of balloon breasts and itty-bitty noses — these avatars or “surries” allow their meat-puppeteers not just to act but also to feel by remote, a state of alienated affairs that has lowered the crime rate while also forcing lumpy, spotty, all-too-human naysayers onto machine-free reservations.  So how does Bruce Willis fit into all this? Not comfortably. But then, if you were a bald action star forced into a dandified blond wig and an f/x face-lift, as he is to play his character’s surrogate, you would sneak looks for the exit too. Although he ditches his creepy counterpart fairly early, Mr. Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue. In this kind of industrial entertainment, particularly one that seems to be missing some connective narrative tissue, it’s hard to know if the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris (working from the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele), or the director, Jonathan Mostow, can be credited or blamed for what’s left on screen.  “Surrogates” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Fisticuffs, gun violence, smashed robots.</text>
