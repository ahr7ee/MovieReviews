      <text> A would-be erotic thriller with no heat and zero chills, “Deception” has the kind of glassy, glossy sheen and risible story that mean to suggest “Basic Instinct” but instead invoke lesser laughers like “Jade” and “Sliver.” A miscast Ewan McGregor plays a mouse who falls in with a charismatic (or so the screenplay insists) stranger played by the miscast Hugh Jackman. One improbable thing leads to another, and suddenly the mouse is roaring, having been inducted into a sex club in which beautiful women in French lingerie crawl around on all fours as if auditioning for a remake of “9  ½ Weeks.” At one point a bony Michelle Williams shows up in a fabulous haircut and towering heels that would fell a lesser woman. Complications ensue.  Directed by the first-timer Marcel Langenegger, whose background in advertising is belied by this movie’s sluggish pace, “Deception” was written by Mark Bomback, who did far better coming up with polysyllabic grunts and groans for Bruce Willis in “Live Free or Die Hard.” As written and directed, the characters in “Deception” are little more than avatars,  generic types (good guy, bad man, fatal blonde), that Mr. Langenegger moves from one busy setup to the next. The venerable cinematographer Dante Spinotti, whose credits include “The Insider,” here works with a dark, almost monochromatic palette and bathes the exteriors in an attractive gun-metal blue, but neither his work nor that of the expert production designer Patrizia von Brandenstein (“The Ice Harvest,” “A Simple Plan”) is enough to save the movie from itself.  Cougar fans take note: Charlotte Rampling plays a sex club denizen, sometimes seminude.  “Deception” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Partly clothed women and gun-toting men.</text>
