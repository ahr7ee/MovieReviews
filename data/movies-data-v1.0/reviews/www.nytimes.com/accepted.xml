      <text> Justin Long is the latest poster boy for corporate anticonformity. As the star of Apple Computer’s “Get a Mac” campaign, he personified the hipness, ease of use and smirking superiority of the company by wearing Vans and poking fun at a stuffy, virus-prone nerd in a suit (i.e., the PC).  Now, in “Accepted,” which with all its glowing Apple logos functions as a feature-length Mac advertisement, Mr. Long further commodifies his dissent in that most oxymoronic of genres, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. He is Bartleby, a clever slacker rejected from college who, with the help of a geek (Jonah Hill), a babe (Maria Thayer), a weirdo (Adam Herschman) and a token black guy (Columbus Short), invents his own university in order to bamboozle his parents and bond with his fellow outcasts.  Classes offered at their South Harmon Institute of Technology  include Doing Nothing, Bumper Stickers, Wingman-ing and a surprisingly effective course in How to Blow Stuff Up With Your Mind. Soon enough, the uptight yes men of Harmon University start sniffing around and unleash the inevitable showdown between righteous Bartleby and the powers that be.  “Accepted” will make for a passable alternative to sold-out shows of “Snakes on a Plane,” but it’s a disappointing debut for the director Steve Pink. Best known for his savvy contribution to the scripts for “Grosse Pointe Blank” and “High Fidelity,” Mr. Pink does what he can with a screenplay by others, keeping his pep in a dumbed-down context and applying his good nature to half-hearted nonsense.  “Accepted” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual slacker shenanigans involving beer drinking, breast ogling and off-color talk.</text>
