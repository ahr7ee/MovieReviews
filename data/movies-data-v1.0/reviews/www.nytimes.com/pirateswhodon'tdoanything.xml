      <text> You don’t have to go far into the press material for “The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie” before you hit the phrase “faith-and-values-based property.” It is used to describe this and earlier offerings from the VeggieTales franchise, but the “faith” component of this rather ordinary film for children doesn’t make itself readily apparent.  Perhaps it’s faith in the notion that if you appropriate chunks of a cinematic classic — in this case “The Wizard of Oz” — your tale will be elevated to classic status too. Perhaps it’s faith in the marketing strategy of borrowing the signature word from the title of someone else’s very popular trilogy and hoping people will turn up at your film thinking that Johnny Depp is providing the voices.  Alas, he is not. Maybe the film is trying to pay Mr. Depp and his “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies homage by dropping in a reference to his earlier “Edward Scissorhands,” even though that film came out at least 10 years before anyone in the target audience was born. Less easy to explain is its reference to “Scarface,” one of the least faith-and-values-based movies ever made.  The writer, Phil Vischer, doesn’t have the ear or timing to make such asides work for the adults or the kiddies; this is no savvy “Toy Story.” It’s a boilerplate plot like one you might find in any morning cartoon. A gourd, a cucumber and an old gent with a purple nose are transported back in time to rescue a prince and princess from pirates. They do and, like the Scarecrow et al., find their brains, courage and heart along the way. An Oz-like man even gives them awards at the end.</text>
