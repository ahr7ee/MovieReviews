      <text> “Conversations With God,” a feature-length commercial for a popular series of inspirational books, ostensibly depicts the life story of the series’ author, Neale Donald Walsch. Played by the doe-eyed Henry Czerny (joining Stephen Baldwin and Kirk Cameron on the “spiritual cinema” bandwagon), Mr. Walsch is in a car accident, loses his job, cannot return to his family (his multiple divorces are alluded to but not explained) and ends up in a homeless encampment near Medford, Ore.  When another job falls through, Mr. Walsch, though not a drinker, hits bottom. Then, like Paul en route to Damascus, he receives a visitation: it’s God, dictating orations in an archetypal baritone. Mr. Walsch channels it all on paper, and becomes rich.  In his public appearances (his books seemingly ever in the frame), audiences,  bemoaning their oppression for being “spiritual,” applaud him repeatedly. A coda after the closing credits, encouraging divine dialogues in general, does little to dispel the hagiographic aftertaste.  Mr. Walsch’s books have sold millions of copies, and his devotees may flock to this movie. Other seekers of enlightenment  might prefer the 2004 New Age curiosity “What the Bleep Do We Know!?,” whose playful sense of scientific inquiry is refreshing by comparison.  “Conversations With God” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild profanity and mild sexual innuendo. </text>
