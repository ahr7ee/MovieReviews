      <text>vid sensation-seeking in "Ma M�re" is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape for the sake of alleged pleasure mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. And make no mistake: fun and pleasure are words these miserable people fling around with a deadly sense of mission. In the crowning joke of the movie, freely adapted from a late novel by the French moral theorist Georges Bataille, an anguished young teenager masturbates beside the corpse of his dead mother, who appears to have cut her own throat just as they were about to consummate their incestuous bond. On the soundtrack, the Turtles' 1967 hit, "Happy Together," bounces away cheerily. "Ma M�re" may be ludicrous, but its cast displays a commitment that deserves more than grudging admiration. The great French actress Isabelle Huppert, whose fondness for the transgressive has led her to star in movies like "The Piano Teacher" and "The School of Flesh," has finally shot the moon with this one. Here she is H�l�ne, a newly widowed, middle-aged sybarite who inhabits the family summer home in the Canary Islands, which she has turned into a multisexual orgy pad with attached swimming pool. With her down-turned mouth, burning gaze and insouciant flounce, Ms. Huppert is equal to the younger Jeanne Moreau in portraying an intense, unleashed sensuality; in Ms. Huppert's case, however, the source of heat seems to be a defiant, bottled-up rage. Louis Garrel (from "The Dreamers") matches her in disquieting power as Pierre, the manic-depressive 17-year-old son she corrupts in the name of what Bataille called a higher "hypermorality," whose principles suggest 20th-century tropes of the Marquis de Sade. Early in the film, H�l�ne announces to Pierre, who has been living with his grandmother and attending a Roman Catholic school in France, that the reason she has seen so little of him is that she is, in her own words, a bitch and a slut. Pierre's reaction is to run down to the beach in tears and pray. Over the course of this archetypally French Catholic movie, Pierre does a lot of weeping, praying and masturbating as H�l�ne competes with the Virgin Mary for his ultimate loyalty. H�l�ne's younger sidekicks in Pierre's secular education, Rea (Joana Preis) and Hansi (Emma de Caunes), are dedicated hedonists with whom she travels around the Mediterranean engaging in joyless sadomasochistic threesomes that involve bondage, boot-licking and verbal abuse. The movie offers a grotesque vision of the Canary Islands as a tourist mecca for predatory middle-aged Europeans with pierced body parts and pot bellies on the prowl for sex. The screenplay is punctuated by H�l�ne's big pronouncements. "I want you to love me for the shame I inspire in you," she tells her son. "The pleasure only begins the moment the worm is in the fruit," she declares. "We must together refuse the world of those who patiently await death to enlighten them," she instructs. In the film's pretentious production notes, the writer and director Christophe Honor� muses windily about the problems of turning the theoretical fiction of an author who died in 1962 into a contemporary movie that still leaves its ideas intact. But the images in "Ma M�re" are so much more powerful and fixed than the fluid ones in our imaginations that the physical reality of the characters trumps the highfalutin verbiage. The film's philosophy plays out on the screen as lessons on how to ruin lives - your own and everyone else's - in the pursuit of depravity. "Ma M�re" is rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It has nudity, simulated sex and graphic language.</text>
