      <text> Anyone who was in New York on 9/11 will certainly be creeped out by some of the shots in “Right at Your Door,” a doomsday-style film by Chris Gorak with a twist worth waiting for. Explosions, presumably engineered by terrorists, leave Los Angeles in a toxic haze, and the long shots of the downtown area shrouded in smoke will bring back all sorts of memories.  But this is no big-budget disaster film. We see the effects of the attack on one household, where Brad (Rory Cochrane) is safe at home when the blasts occur but his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack), is caught in the virus-laced ash on her way to work. The third star of the film is duct tape: Brad seals up as instructed by the radio and then must make a decision when the contagious Lexi returns home.  The film, especially in its resolution, feels a bit like a “Twilight Zone” episode and might have been better at that length, but the acting’s pretty good, and the cinematography keeps things lively.  “Right at Your Door” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for a lot of the same words you would probably say if you were sprinkled with lethal fallout.</text>
