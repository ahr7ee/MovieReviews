      <text>Correction Appended Children see more than they understand, and understand more than they know. Their intense, limited way of perceiving the world, sometimes sentimentally rendered as moral innocence, is one of the reasons they are frequently placed at the center of movies about war, revolution and other forms of social upheaval and political disaster. Gonzalo (Mat�as Quer), the 11-year-old boy at the center of Andr�s Wood's "Machuca," is warily edging toward adolescence, preoccupied with the petty brutality of the schoolyard and the unspoken miseries of his upper-middle class Santiago household. But because his coming of age takes place in Chile in 1973, his ordinary hardships, joys and rites of passage are charged with inordinate tension. The audience, aware from the start that the military coup against Salvador Allende's government lurks on the horizon, feels their sympathy for this child - and their more general nostalgia for childhood - shadowed by anxiety and dread. For the most part Mr. Wood, who based the film on events from his own early life, confines the story to Gonzalo's perspective. Intimations of Chile's volatile political situation pop up almost casually, via the television set, graffiti in the street and overheard adult conversations. But there is no queston that Gonzalo's private world, like his country, is in a state of ferment. A soft-faced, passive boy, he is forced to accompany his mother (Aline K�ppenheim) on visits to her lover, an older, wealthy sensualist who buys the boy's complicity with handsome bound editions of Lone Ranger comics. At home, Gonzalo has to deal with his weak-willed father and his sister's loutish boyfriend. At the private English-language boys' school Gonzalo attends, the headmaster (Ernesto Malbran), a priest flush with the experimental, egalitarian spirit of the Allende government, has granted scholarships to a few boys from the nearby slums. One of them, Pedro Machuca (Ariel Mateluna), becomes Gonzalo's friend, and introduces him to another side of life in Santiago. Pedro also introduces Gonzalo to Silvana (Manuela Martelli), a tough, fearless shantytown girl who becomes their frequent companion, and the crux of a sweet romantic triangle that makes parts of "Machuca" resemble a juvenile "Jules and Jim." The three friends help Silvana's father take advantage of the political situation by selling flags at competing demonstrations, and play kissing games on the banks of a muddy creek. "Machuca," which opens today at Film Forum and which is Chile's submission to this year's Academy Awards, is both sweet and stringent, attuned to the wonders of childhood as well as its cruelty and terror. Mr. Wood allows the story to unfold at a leisurely, almost dawdling pace, which matches the consciousness of his young protagonist. There are moments that feel forced and schematic - in particular those that insist on revealing Gonzalo's school as a microcosm of a society riven by class and ideology. The greater achievement of the film lies in showing both the weakness and the tenacity of those divisions. The friendship between Gonzalo and Pedro shows how arbitrary they are, and how affection and decency can overcome such differences. But historical circumstances rule out false comfort or redemptive optimism. Mr. Wood ends Gonzalo's youthful idyll with a few short, painful strokes -scenes of the military takeover that capture the harsh, emphatic force with which authoritarian rule announces its arrival. The television proclaims that the army has restored order, and a newspaper headline proclaims the return of normalcy. But the scenes of soldiers taking over Gonzalo's school and subduing Pedro's neighborhood show the reality behind the euphemisms. While Mr. Wood's political sympathies are clearly with the victims of the coup, he never suggests that the events of September 1973 were simple, or that they can be easily understood. But "Machuca" nonetheless has a tough, heavy clarity. Its point is not to settle scores or reopen old wounds, but rather to explore, after a long period of repression, the possibility of grief. The youthful condition it evokes most strongly is not innocence but impotence - the discovery that you are powerless to protect the people you care about from harm, and also powerless to protect yourself against the shame of your own failure.</text>
