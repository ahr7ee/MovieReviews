      <text> If you were a stunningly beautiful woman whose husband would rather have his back waxed than his fancy tickled, would your suspicions be aroused? Not if you were Zoë (Bárbara Mori), a vapid wife whose brain activates just long enough each day to tally the 20 grapes she eats for breakfast. When not counting tiny fruit, Zoë longs for children, but her de-furred spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. With six days of mounting sexual tension to defuse, Zoë turns for comfort to her rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose Ralph Lauren underwear beckons enticingly from above the waistband of his low-slung jeans. Ay caramba!  With its overheated narrative, lush interiors and photogenic cast, "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" is a big-screen telenovela in which everyone is cheating and every light is flattering. Written by Jaime Bayly (adapting his own novel), the movie bubbles with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality — steamy themes that incite the cast to fits of enthusiastic overemoting. The Peruvian director Ricardo de Montreuil counters all this heaving passion with elegant images and subtle camera movements, helped by Angelo Milli's classy score. But it's a lot of trouble to go to for a movie that considers procreation more important than honesty and what we want more important than who we are.  "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has picturesque sex, titillating language and excessive use of lip gloss.</text>
