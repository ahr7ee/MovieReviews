      <text> Shot piecemeal over the course of four years on locations in  18 countries, and paid for out of the pocket of its co-writer and director, Tarsem Singh, “The Fall” is a genuine labor of love  —  and a real bore. The story takes place once upon a time in a picturesque Los Angeles hospital, where a pudgy Romanian 5-year-old named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) convalesces from a broken arm. Befriending her fellow patient Roy Walker (Lee Pace), a movie stuntman with busted legs and a cracked spirit, Alexandra sits enthralled as Roy relates an epic tale of colorful heroes seeking revenge on the nefarious Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone). The details of this saga, a threadbare patchwork of postcard exoticism, turgid characterizations, stilted duels and lackluster spectacle, are projected via the imagination of a little girl cognizant, it would seem, of the full repertory of high-gloss, empty-headed pictorialism deployed by corporate advertising.  Tarsem, as the filmmaker prefers to be called, made his name marketing soft drinks and sneakers, and “The Fall” bids to sell its audience on a visionary quest full of romance, intrigue, fabulous sights and fantastic creatures (Charles Darwin, swimming elephants, white people with dreadlocks). It’s strictly bargain bin.  “The Fall” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). With the exception of a moist bundle of flayed corpses, the film’s mild fantasy violence scarcely warrants so restrictive a rating.</text>
