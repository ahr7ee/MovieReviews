      <text>ings and Queen" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Manohla Dargis's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 6, 2004; the full text is online at nytimes.com/movies.  The unrated film is in French with English subtitles. Late in his new film "Kings and Queen," the wildly gifted French director Arnaud Desplechin yanks the rug from under his characters and sends both them and us reeling. Up until that point, Mr. Desplechin has seemed like a disinterested witness to the goings-on of his two principal characters, Nora (Emmanuelle Devos), a bourgeois mother who runs an art gallery, and her former lover, a violist named Isma�l (Mathieu Amalric). But any idea that Mr. Desplechin has opted for some kind of authorial neutrality, a behind-the-scenes politesse, as it were, vanishes when a third character abruptly delivers a late-act speech so steeped in bile it upends everything we think we've understood in this story. This shocking deus ex machina follows a welter of narrative complication and piercing drama shot through with a rich vein of absurdist humor. The story begins pacifically with a shot of a city street corner and a man delivering a brief synopsis of the myth of Zeus and Leda in voice-over. (More on that later.) The song "Moon River," the haunting, sickly sweet theme song from the film "Breakfast at Tiffany's," floods the soundtrack as Mr. Desplechin introduces Nora, first seen on the street, then talking to someone off-screen. Some two hours later, the filmmaker will again cue "Moon River," Nora will again talk to her unseen interlocutor and Mr. Desplechin will deliver the manifestly unbelievable assurance that "the cycle of woes is over." These opening and closing scenes could suggest that everything in between emanates from Nora's point of view, but that would be too easy for a director as wily as Mr. Desplechin. As he has shown in features like "My Sex Life, or How I Got Into an Argument," still his crowning work, and the boldly experimental "Esther Kahn," Mr. Desplechin has no interest in polishing narrative like a gemstone; he would rather take a chisel to it. If "Kings and Queen" doesn't initially seem as radical as the director's earlier work, it's only because Mr. Desplechin crams in so much about his characters and takes the story on so many apparent detours, and with relative speed, that it's difficult to linger in the scenes for long. As the film shifts from Nora to Isma�l and back again, slowly at first, then with increasing urgency, Nora visits her father, Jennsens (Maurice Garrel), and discovers he's critically ill. She hospitalizes him and, frantic with grief and consumed with worry about the future of her young son, tracks down Isma�l in an attempt to enlist his help. Isma�l, meanwhile, has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, where he flirts with the nurses and beds Arielle (Magali Woch), a young patient eager to help him pass the time. During his stay at the hospital, Isma�l will venture off the grounds to see his star-psychoanalyst and receive regular visits from his madcap lawyer, Mr. Manne (Hippolyte Girardot). He will also visit a hospital supervisor (Catherine Deneuve) and make the startling claim that women have no souls. All this happens, every last scene, but how it happens and what it means for the various characters changes the instant that Mr. Desplechin drops in one and then a second deus ex machina. It's only after the second hits, and it hits you like a blow, that you realize that until this point everything has been filtered exclusively through Nora and Isma�l, two radically self-interested subjectivities. This at least appears to be the case with Nora, who, as if permanently adrift on Moon River, lives a charmed existence beloved by all the men in her life (the "kings" of the film's title) and has survived unscathed by even the gravest personal tragedy. The outside world may think that Isma�l is mad, but in the logic of the story it's Nora who seems lost. Mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust, subject of loathing, Nora will mean many different things to the kings by the time Mr. Desplechin brings down the curtain on this curious tale. Like Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," Nora will shed tears that linger beautifully on her cheek and dry before the closing credits. Along the way to Nora's perhaps mythical ending, the filmmaker will insert images from classical myth as if to remind us that desire turns ordinary mortals into gods. It's worth remembering, then, that when the narrator first tells the story of Leda and the Swan, he says that "Zeus loved Leda and came to her in the form of a swan." What he doesn't say is that Zeus came to Leda in duplicity and ravaged her without pity.  </text>
