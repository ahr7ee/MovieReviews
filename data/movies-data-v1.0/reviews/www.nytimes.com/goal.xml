      <text> Attempting an unfortunate blend of Newcastle grit and Hollywood uplift, "Goal! The Dream Begins" is the improbable story of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker), a young Mexican immigrant and amateur soccer star living in Los Angeles. Against the wishes of his conservative father (Tony Plana), who urges a secure future in the lawn-care business, Santiago follows the advice of a talent scout (Stephen Dillane) and heads to England for a tryout with Newcastle United.  Battling asthma attacks, hostile players and the ghastly Tyneside weather, Santiago gains a one-month trial; and before you can yell  "Foul!"  he's playing alongside the captain, Alan Shearer, and teaching his teammates the importance of clean living and hard work. One can only imagine their gratitude.  "Goal! The Dream Begins" is the kickoff to a trilogy of movies hoping to do for soccer what Kevin Costner has done for baseball. But though Mr. Becker's depressingly bland performance is countered by excellent work from both Alessandro Nivola as the team's resident playboy and the Romanian actor Marcel Iures as its paternalistic manager, the movie continually strains credulity.  As the clich√©s mount, Danny Cannon directs as if he's the one on trial, teasing tension out of every pass and dribble. Most irritating of all is his determination to paint British soccer as a gentleman's game,  a notion United's real fans would no doubt treat with the scorn it deserves.  "Goal! The Dream Begins" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A hint of sex, a whiff of drugs and an avalanche of corn.</text>
