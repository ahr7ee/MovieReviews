      <text> Parents wishing to stupefy their youngest children for an hour and a half might consider plopping them in front of “Fly Me to the Moon”  —  but only if a fourth viewing of “Wall-E” or a second trip to “Space Chimps” or a really bright flashlight shining in their eyes is completely out of the question.  “Fly Me to the Moon” bills itself as the first animated feature created expressly for 3-D. As these things go, this one goes well enough: the 3-D effects are sophisticated and incorporated into the overall design of the picture rather than trumpeted by random, poke-in-the-eye flourishes, although the movie does have an annoying habit of sneezing and burping in your face.  Still, too bad it wasn’t created expressly for, you know, pleasure or art.  Written by Domonic Paris and directed by Ben Stassen, the film involves a threesome of Florida houseflies stowing away on Apollo 11. One of the most undermotivated plots in many a moon, the zero-wit, zero-gravity misadventures of Nat (the voice of Trevor Gagnon), I.Q. (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) are embarked on merely because they’re bored on their garbage dump.</text>
