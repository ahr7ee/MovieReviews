      <text> In “December Boys,” Daniel Radcliffe takes a holiday from Harry Potter to play another orphan, this time of the Muggle variety. Too bad his destination is a coming-of-age tale so treacly it doesn’t just tug your heartstrings, it attempts to glue them to your ribs.  As Maps, one of four boys who share a December birthday and the hospitality of a Catholic orphanage in the Australian outback, Mr. Radcliffe may be audience bait but he’s not the film’s fulcrum. That would be Misty (Lee Cormie), a bespectacled dreamer who longs for parents and discovers potential candidates when the boys receive the unexpected gift of a seaside vacation.    While Maps learns about sex, ciggies and Creedence Clearwater Revival from the local wild child (Teresa Palmer), his buddies vie to be adopted by a fairground worker and his seductive wife (Sullivan Stapleton and Victoria Hill). But when the inevitable tragedy strikes — in the form of death, abandonment and a clay-footed hero — its emotional heft is diluted by a screenplay (by Marc Rosenberg, working from Michael Noonan’s novel) mired in fantasy. As cartwheeling nuns frolic on the sand and visions of the Virgin Mary glow beneath the waves, the movie congeals into a soggy, symbolic mess.  As for Mr. Radcliffe, his acting is fine. It’s his career planning that needs some work.  “December Boys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The boys moon the camera, peep at naked women and enjoy a variety of under-age activities.</text>
