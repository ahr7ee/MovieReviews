      <text>iven the number of films that have featured astonishing performances from real-life street children - the Brazilian films "Pixote" and "City of God" spring to mind, as well as Mira Nair's "Salaam Bombay!" or Truffaut's "400 Blows" - the law of averages demands that every once in a while a movie must come along starring young nonprofessional actors who aren't very good. That's unfortunately the case in "15," a Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth. The film, which opens today at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village, is a loosely connected series of vignettes that follow five young residents of a public housing project as they smuggle drugs, ponder suicide and smoke tragically in slow motion while a single rose petal wafts by in the wind. "15" is the first feature film of Royston Tan, 28, who got his start making music videos - a pedigree evident in the film's use of quick cuts, flashy intertitles and video-game-like animated sequences.
