      <text> Cara-Ethyl (Kylie Sparks) is unpopular and overweight, but as she's a character in an American independent movie, she is also vivacious and quirky. No one has shown up for her 18th-birthday party, so she busies herself scooping chunks of chocolate cake with a finger and pretending to talk to a girlfriend for the benefit of her mother (Julie Hagerty), recently blinded in a freak doughnut frying accident.  Enter Matt (Ethan Embry), a pizza delivery dude with puppy dog eyes and a handful of pepperoni pies. Before you can say "we should have ordered Chinese," this soulful slacker absconds with the birthday girl for a night of misadventure and carpe diem clich√©s.  Written and directed by Mark Christopher ("54"), "Pizza" is a thin slice of flavorless whimsy heavily garnished with contrivance. As Cara-Ethyl and Matt inexplicably bond - bad writing can bring anyone together - one phony situation follows another: couch time with grungy roommates; deliveries to assorted oddballs; nightclub follies; humiliation at a make-out party. The tone is half mocking, half forthright and completely boring.  Less egregious than simply unnecessary, this least enlightening of movies nevertheless delivers a bittersweet lesson. Compare it with 2003's brooding "Crimson Gold," another pizza-themed opus about a fat outcast, and "Pizza" reveals how stale the ambitions of so much homegrown filmmaking have become.</text>
