      <text> A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless hommage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear, “Alien Trespass” proves only that while styles and technology have moved on, the affection for corn is everlasting.  Spearheading this retro revival is Eric McCormack as a prissy astronomer whose cardigan-sweatered body is co-opted in the first act by a foil-wrapped alien. “My name is Urp,” he announces to a perky diner waitress (a scene-stealing Jenni Baird).  “Would you like some Rolaids?” she inquires brightly, demonstrating the script’s notion of humor and her own deadpan skills. But as Urp tracks a tentacled beastie by means of the sticky remains of its human dinners, we wait in vain for the director, R. W. Goodwin, to display more than just fan-boy obsession. Substituting period accuracy — a keening theremin, a rubbery monster and a cast of 10s — for ideas, he and his writers (James Swift and Steven Fisher) stay well clear of the mushroom-clouded corners of the American psyche.  As a result the cast is compelled to play along without wink or subtext, a skill at which the women excel. Fortified with Cross-Your-Heart technology and gorgeous makeup, Ms. Baird and Jody Thompson (as  the scientist’s silky, hot-to-trot wife) act their male colleagues into the margins. Compared with wrangling foundation garments and seamed stockings, besting monsters is a breeze.  “Alien Trespass” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A phallus-shaped monster and a human-shaped alien.</text>
