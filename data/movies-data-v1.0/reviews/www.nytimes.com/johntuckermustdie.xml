      <text> More and more, today’s teen comedies send me running to the video store for a fix of John Hughes. At least there’s a heart beating behind his goofy-sweet tales of high school awkwardness. Not so in Betty Thomas’s “John Tucker Must Die,” a dispiriting revenge fantasy engineered by three waspish Barbies against one disposable Ken.  The titular target is a preening basketball star (Jesse Metcalfe) whose queen-bee girlfriends plot payback for the damage he has supposedly inflicted on their brittle little hearts. When attempts to discredit his masculinity and genital hygiene misfire, the ladies bait a love trap with never-been-kissed Kate (Brittany Snow), a nerd with anonymity issues. After the inevitable mouse-to-hottie makeover, Kate is ready to turn John on then snuff him out. Metaphorically speaking.  Unforgivably clueless about teen culture (how many high-school iPods are currently blasting Cheap Trick?), “John Tucker Must Die” can’t even sustain the courage of its girl-power convictions, switching allegiance in the final reel. Yet there’s a Parker Posey snap to Sophia Bush’s portrayal of the vegan girlfriend, and Penn Badgley is wildly charismatic in the role of John Tucker’s younger brother. The entire picture could hang on his cheekbones alone.  If only Mr. Metcalfe shared his talents. Mustering fewer expressions than a Botox infomercial, he struggles to emote even when his character’s protein shake is spiked with estrogen. “I’m anxious and bloated and my nipples hurt!” he whines unconvincingly. Doesn’t he know that acting well is the best revenge?  “John Tucker Must Die” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has boys in thongs, girls in bras and comedy in peril.</text>
