      <text> If you’re going to make anything as ridiculous as a talking-dog movie, you might as well go all the way. “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” approaches but never quite achieves a truly spectacular level of absurdity;  that is, until it reaches the ancient Aztec homeland of the fearsome Chihuahua race.  Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), the pampered pooch of a megarich cosmetics mogul (Jamie Lee Curtis, in the flesh), is lost in Mexico and about to be devoured by three poorly animated cougars. Enter a mighty tribe of feral Chihuahuas with digital lips, who sweep Chloe away and teach her the power of saying “no más.”  No más to funny little outfits! No más to sitting on laps! You are Chihuahua! Where is your bark?  Chloe does indeed find her bark, which evidently has the power to make nearby architecture collapse. As for Rachel (Piper Perabo), the empty-headed dog sitter who misplaced her rich aunt’s most prized possession in the first place, she learns that it’s  O.K. to love the Mexican gardener (Manolo Cardona) as long as he’s outrageously handsome, speaks perfect English and calls himself a “landscaper.”  As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, “Chihuahua” is reasonably diverting. As one that happens to be opening  in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane.  “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It flaunts obscene  wealth  and ethnic stereotypes.</text>
