      <text> The feature-film debut of the 26-year-old Flemish filmmaker Felix van Groeningen, "Steve + Sky" is the story of how Steve (Titus De Voogdt), a scruffy small-time hoodlum just released from jail, falls for Sky (Delfine Bafort), a na√Øve young prostitute trying to get out of the life.  When Jean-Claude (Johan Heldenbergh), a wheelchair-bound motorcycle thief who was Steve's cellmate in prison, invites them both to help him start a strip joint in his house on the outskirts of Antwerp, Steve and Sky find themselves sharing a back room at the makeshift "club." Slowly these two inarticulate, damaged individuals begin to form a fragile bond. But when Jean-Claude decides to evade his debtors by moving to Slovenia and taking Steve with him, the couple must reassess what they really mean to each other.  With its deliberately washed-out color palette, affectless dialogue and nearly event-free story line, "Steve + Sky" is a mere slip of a movie, a wan character study of people who add up to little more than a series of studied quirks. Mr. van Groeningen reshuffles the order of some scenes and returns repeatedly to others, perhaps in an attempt to lend an aura of destiny to the lead couple's banal courtship; instead, these temporal shifts merely render the story more murky.  But at least the film can boast two strong leads: Mr. De Voogdt plays the would-be tough guy Steve with some of the restrained intensity of a young Sean Penn, while Ms. Bafort, a model, is ravishing as the self-destructive Sky, the kind of girl who handles her frustration by running headlong into walls while wearing an unending succession of stylishly punky outfits.</text>
