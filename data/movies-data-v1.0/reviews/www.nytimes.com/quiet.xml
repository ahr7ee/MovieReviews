      <text> Once upon a time, two beautiful teenagers meet cute and contrived when the good brunette, the newly orphaned Dot (Camilla Belle), moves in with the family of the bad blonde, Nina Deer (Elisha Cuthbert). But while Nina’s space-case mother (Edie Falco) and father (Martin Donovan) warmly welcome the stray, their daughter is soon making like Paris Hilton and mercilessly cutting the interloper down to Nicole Richie size. Deaf and mute and friendless, Dot in turn takes to studying Nina as impassively as an ethnographer in the field. Is she smitten with the other girl or just biding her sweet vengeful time? The answer is less obvious than Ms. Falco and Mr. Donovan’s substandard performances, though rather less compelling than the sight of Nina ironing her cheerleader’s uniform in her underwear.  Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, “The Quiet” flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. The director Jamie Babbit, whose films include “But I’m a Cheerleader,” suggestively crowds her two talented leads together, but can’t push them or the film into the fairy-tale surrealism to which she seems to aspire. She dutifully trots out the usual family horrors (a criminally creepy father, a chemically addled mother) so beloved by both exploitation auteurs and the Sundance labs,  where Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft developed their screenplay. But what she can’t tap is that go-for-broke lunacy that makes a flick like “Wild Things” a classic of its trashy kind and might have saved this film from that cinematic slag heap known as late August.  “The Quiet” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for dirty words and deeds.</text>
