      <text>ierre Salvadori's meandering comedy "Apr�s Vous" offers the pleasure of watching the great French actor Daniel Auteuil squirm delicately through the role of the world's most overzealous, uptight good Samaritan. With a slight wrinkle of the nose and a hardening of his expression, Mr. Auteuil can morph from a rabbity milquetoast into a shark. The expression he wears through much of the movie is a half-and-half look of pained exasperation, which lets him wring a hundred variations on the discomfort of someone forced to appear composed amid chaos of his own devising. His character, Antoine, manages a snooty Parisian restaurant where wine is the thing. His life changes the night he saves a stranger by dashing into a park and cutting the noose  as he is about to hang himself. With Louis (Jos� Garcia), the would-be suicide, protesting every step of the way, Antoine drags him home to the apartment he shares with Christine (Marilyne Canto), his girlfriend of three years. And over her strenuous objections, Antoine makes it his personal mission to fix everything wrong in Louis's life. A neurotic, self-pitying drama queen, whom Mr. Garcia plays as a manipulative crybaby wallowing in misery with a mischievous, barely disguised sense of enjoyment, Louis is a good Samaritan's worst nightmare. Because he has already mailed a farewell letter to his grandparents, Antoine takes it upon himself to intercept this final bleat of agony and to improvise a phony message of well-being, which he recites to Louis's nearly blind grandmother (Andr�e Tainsy). Next on Antoine's things-to-do list is to give Louis a crash course in wine stewardship and then cajole the hard-bitten owner of the restaurant he manages into hiring Louis as its new sommelier. The scene in which Louis, tongue-tied and panic-stricken, auditions for the job and gargles the sample from his wine-tasting test while Antoine frantically coaches him in sign language is the movie's funniest. It is nearly matched by Louis's complete ineptitude on the job, which Antoine tries to cover up by paying for high-priced wines that make Louis look like a persuasive salesman. If "Apr�s Vous" maintained this level of humor, it might have been a classic of its kind. But once Antoine tries to salvage Louis's miserable love life, the movie goes flat. The immediate spur to Louis's act of self-destruction was his being dumped by his willowy, poker-faced girlfriend, Blanche (Sandrine Kiberlain), whom Antoine tracks down at the flower shop where she works. Insinuating himself into her life, he begins to meddle and pull strings, and the story starts to lose track of itself in these increasingly bewildering, unfunny romantic shenanigans. As the movie drags on for nearly two hours, you get the uneasy sense that Mr. Salvadori and his screenwriting collaborators are making it up as they go along. The farcical tone softens, and the visual jokes fizzle. Ms. Kiberlain, when well used in the movies, conveys an ambiguous mixture of fragility and backbone, but her subtle acting style is not suited for farce. The use of comic leitmotifs  -  a cardboard cutout of Blanche's profile, a telltale cigarette lighter that is passed from one character to another, and the oft-quoted phrase "narcissistic injury"  -  lends the movie an appearance of form, even after its structure has crumbled. Had it had the concision and symmetry of a classic French farce, "Apr�s Vous" could have been an irresistible laugh machine. "Apr�s Vous" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexual situations.</text>
