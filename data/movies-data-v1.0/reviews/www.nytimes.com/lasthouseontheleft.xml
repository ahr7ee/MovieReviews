      <text> Three years ago the French director Alexandre Aja spun Wes Craven’s cannibal classic,  “The Hills Have Eyes,” into horror-movie gold. The polishing of the Craven oeuvre — and the punishing of innocent families — continues with “The Last House on the Left,” a toned-down, tarted-up remake of that auteur’s infamously brutal 1972 debut film.  A study of operatic vengeance and dueling family values, this stylish renovation by Dennis Iliadis remains mostly true to the original story of a bereaved couple (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) whose teenage daughter (Sara Paxton) is attacked by a clan of on-the-lam sociopaths. Replacing the earlier movie’s more depraved sequences with sustained tension and truly unnerving editing, the director proves adept at managing mayhem in cramped spaces: a six-person struggle in a barreling S.U.V. is a small miracle of controlled chaos.  Working with the cinematographer Sharone Meir (who shot the marvelously oppressive “Mean Creek”), Mr. Iliadis alternates visceral violence — a knife slowly entering a girl’s quivering stomach, a garbage disposal chewing relentlessly on a man’s hand — with interludes of dreamy anxiety. And though I have never actually heard a skull exploding in a microwave, I suspect the movie’s sound designers deserve some kind of an award: thanks to them, the damage one can inflict with small appliances and a giant grudge is all too clear.  “The Last House on the Left” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are raped, stabbed, shot, mangled and fed to labor-saving devices.</text>
