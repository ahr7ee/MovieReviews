      <text> A misfired attempt at provocation and the exploration of philosophical thought, "London" is little more than an immature display of male bonding on speed. Bateman (Jason Statham) and Syd (Chris Evans) are two strangers — a drug dealer and his customer — who spend an intense evening, mostly holed up in a bathroom, ingesting suicidal levels of alcohol and cocaine, shouting obscenities and engaging in some quieter, supposedly revelatory guys' talk that hits upon S-and-M, impotency and the meaning of life. They are interrupted by flashbacks chronicling the explosive relationship of Syd and his "ex-chick" London (Jessica Biel), whose going-away party Syd and Bateman have crashed, and the occasional trashy woman wanting in on the drug action so badly that she doesn't seem to mind that she's in the company of serious misogynists.  The writer and director Hunter Richards's debut film features a thoroughly unsympathetic cast of characters, weak performances (though the supporting actors fare better than the leads) and a script that is laughable, minus a few exceptions, in all the wrong places. Though the action moves along at a decent pace — a somewhat honorable feat, considering the film's setting — there is not one character you'd wish to meet, much less spend the duration of a movie with.  "London" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has excessive drug use, sex, harsh language and some violence.</text>
