      <text> Nostalgia carried beyond a certain point becomes a form of stupidity. And, as a poet once said, stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace. “Flyboys” ascends close enough to this danger zone to singe its wings, yearning for a time when wars were fought by gentlemen, combat was glamorous and the French were amused by monolingual Americans.  Ostensibly, this would be the First World War as experienced by the Lafayette Escadrille, a pack of American boys who volunteered as Allied pilots before the United States entered the war. Under French command, they flew against the Germans in wood and canvas contraptions about as well engineered as a love seat from Ikea.  Of this history, “Flyboys” makes a soppy fantasy, representing war with approximately the level of realism marshaled by “Team America: World Police.” Leading the puppet people is James Franco as Blaine Rawlings, a cowboy with blond highlights who takes time off from killing to woo a French country girl (Jennifer Decker). Joining him are a blue blood (Tyler Labine), a black boxer (Abdul Salis), a screw-up (David Ellison) and Jean Reno as a French captain, hamming it up like a supersized croque monsieur.  Despite its empty head and arduous length, “Flyboys” is ever so nice, in the manner of a Norman Rockwell illustration. The director, Tony Bill, may not be a philosopher but he is a gentleman, moving things along with a tidy, well-mannered hand. In another context, such politesse might feel tonic. Given the state of things, it’s nearly toxic.  “Flyboys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Frenzies of C.G.I. and squirts of fake blood.</text>
