      <text> Anyone popping in to "Psychopathia Sexualis" hoping for a classier "Basic Instinct" or perhaps a sneak peek at Woody Allen's memoirs will be sorely disappointed. Named for the notorious 1886 text by Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist whose specialty was sexual perversion, the movie reconstructs four of the book's colorful case histories. But applying the scientific method to carnal behavior is one thing; applying it to moviemaking is quite another.  Trapping his kinky material in a cage of Victorian propriety, the writer and director, Bret Wood, mimics the visual style of silent cinema, complete with wooden tableaus and ornate intertitles.  As hysterical violins sob in the background, we see an onanistic mama's boy discover the joys of bloodsucking, and a wealthy masochist trampled by a pair of bored-looking prostitutes. There's necrophilia, and there are sheep (thankfully unmolested), but there is not one moment of fun.  Whether in the whorehouse or the sanitarium, "Psychopathia Sexualis" is an exercise in unrelenting dullness. Its troubled characters may clamber into coffins,  ogle chickens and play with leeches, but it's all pleasureless. Bodily fluids and whippings alike are delivered and received with no more enthusiasm than that of a bivalve processing its dinner. If Sharon Stone were to greet sexual deviance with such sang-froid, she'd never work again.</text>
