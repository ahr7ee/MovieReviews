      <text> With a surrogate for every demographic and a heroine for every taste, “Casi Divas” jiggles and jokes its way around as many Mexican box-office bases as possible. Such calculated commercialism, however, doesn’t preclude loftier goals, and as the film picks up speed it also accrues a socially progressive agenda. If only this were half as well developed as the female leads.  Harnessing the familiar tropes of the pageant drama, the writer and director, Issa Lopez, introduces us to four young competitors vying for the lead in the film version of a popular telenovela. There’s a shy country beauty hiding behind a unibrow (Maya Zapata); a ruthless banker’s daughter still smarting from the humiliations of a pudgy past (Ana Layevska); a theatrical hairstylist from an unsavory section of Mexico City (Daniela Schmidt); and a troubled factory worker from Ciudad Juárez who lives in constant fear of being kidnapped (Diana Garcia).  Touching on racism (one contestant is Mexican Indian), ageism and homophobia (a surprise I won’t divulge), Ms. Lopez keeps the tone light and the emphasis on self-knowledge. The fusion of social consciousness and slapstick can grate, but the young actresses are appealing (most notably Ms. Garcia) and the message innocuous: Friends matter more than money, the poor matter more than the rich, and the wounded matter most of all. Who can argue with any of that?  “Casi Divas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Sex as gift, bribe, weapon and burden.</text>
