      <text> Despite the broad humor that inhabits it, the land of Madcap is fairly small, and very difficult for a filmmaker to hit. In his sour little movie "When Do We Eat?," the director Salvador Litvak, like many before him, misses the target, landing instead in the adjacent territories of Tries Too Hard and Bad Taste.  Ira Stuckman (Michael Lerner) is determined to drag his family through a Seder, and what a strenuously quirky family it is. One daughter (Shiri Appleby) is some kind of sex worker; another (Meredith Scott Lynn) brings her lesbian partner to the meal. One son (Max Greenfield) seems to have recently discovered Hasidism; another (Ben Feldman) confesses that he slipped Ira a tab of Ecstasy at the start of the gathering. Mom (Lesley Ann Warren) has a strange male friend (Mark Ivanir), and Grandpa (Jack Klugman) no doubt wishes he were back in "The Odd Couple." And let's not even get into the side plot that involves making a joke out of autism.  It's fine — healthy, even — to treat religious holidays with a little levity, but a certain respect is also mandatory. Mr. Litvak makes a late, halfhearted stab at that, but given the earlier goings-on (particularly a family discussion of whether the sex Mr. Greenfield's character just had with his cousin in the next room constituted incest), it's clear that this film has nothing but contempt for what some people hold sacred.  "When Do We Eat?" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and drug use.</text>
