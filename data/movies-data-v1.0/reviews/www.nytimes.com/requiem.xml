      <text> Like “The Exorcism of Emily Rose,” the 2005 film directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson, “Requiem” is loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcisms.  But while the earlier film was a histrionic, effects-laden court battle between the secular and the spiritual, Hans-Christian Schmid’s thoughtful drama is content to explore a single question: Why would an intelligent young woman, experiencing terrifying seizures, willingly choose exorcism over medical intervention?  Working from a script by Bernd Lange, Mr. Schmid traces the mental decline of 21-year-old Michaela (a devastating Sandra Hüller), a devout college freshman already on medication for epilepsy. Exchanging the religious constraints of her small-town home for an easygoing campus dorm, Michaela acquires a boyfriend (Nicholas Reinke), a best friend (Anna Blomeier) and a social life. But a stressful combination of circumstances — including first-time sex, a pathologically critical mother (Imogen Kogge) and the strain of concealing her illness — causes her seizures to return, accompanied by voices and hallucinations.  Desperate, Michaela turns to the Roman Catholic Church, only to be caught between dueling clerical opinions. And though her father (Burghart Klaussner) is loving, his faith in science is no match for a wife who finds demonic possession easier to acknowledge than mental illness.  Balancing Ms. Hüller’s astonishingly physical performance with an intimate, naturalistic style, “Requiem” is a moving study of a tortured young woman more at peace with medieval ritual than with modern medicine. Throughout, Mr. Schmid remains agnostic, suggesting that Michaela’s problems, whatever their origin, prove only that a mind in torment is a terrible thing.</text>
