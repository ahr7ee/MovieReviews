      <text>s nursing homes go, Meadow View, the site of Elliot Greenebaum's hardheaded comedy "Assisted Living," is a far cry from the places we sometimes read about where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners. The rooms are clean, the staff is efficient, and the lounge has a giant television. The residents, many in  wheelchairs, are led through stretching exercises or sit in a circle and toss around a beach ball. The staff is extremely protective, insisting that special sun-protecting goggles be worn for excursions outdoors to the lawn. What little excitement  can be stirred up revolves around games of bingo. There is a beloved house pet, a golden retriever named Randy, and there is also entertainment. In one scene, a singer serenades a group with "On the Sunny Side of the Street" and "Blue Skies." But all this strenuous perkiness doesn't make for a joyful environment. The faces of the residents remain frozen. Conversations tend to be bickering matches in which two people claw at each other to command the television's remote control. Most  remarks addressed to staff members are peevish complaints. And the glad-handing chief administrator, Hance Purcell, is a secret tippler who carries on an ominous domestic battle over his office telephone. Life in Meadow View is viewed through the eyes of Todd (Michael Bonsignore), the institution's scruffy 27-year-old janitor, who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot, is careless about punctuality and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom. In the most outrageous stunt, he telephones a patient from an adjoining room and pretends to be a deceased loved one describing the wonders of heaven. One delight of the hereafter, he promises, is all the sex you want without the inconvenience of a body. "Assisted Living," which opens today at the Angelika Film Center in New York, has the guardedly facetious tone of a fake documentary, filmed at a nursing home in Kentucky and incorporating many of the actual residents. It is not always easy to tell the difference between the actors and nonactors. The wisp of a plot follows Todd's relationship with Mrs. Pearlman (Maggie Riley), a patient suffering from early Alzheimer's who is obsessed with leaving Meadow View to join her son in Australia. The old woman, who wears a white wide-brimmed hat, still carries herself with a certain dignity, studies her image in a mirror and is sentient enough to deny she has Alzheimer's, which she calls "it," refusing to say the dreaded word. When Todd calls her, pretending to be her son, her happiness quickly turns to agitation, and she has an emotional meltdown. Thereafter, she begins to confuse the two men. If Ms. Riley's portrayal of a patient who is hanging on, despite having lost much of her grip, is the movie's emotional center, it is a thoroughly unsentimental performance. This dry little film steers clear of rose-colored Hollywood clichï¿½s, in which adorable old folks dispense nuggets of homey wisdom to their confused great-grandchildren. "Assisted Living" may be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling. As the camera fixates on frail, spotted trembling hands unsteadily reaching out, it is impossible not to imagine a future in which those hands could be yours.</text>
