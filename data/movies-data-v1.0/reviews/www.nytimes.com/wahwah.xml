      <text> Set to the death rattle of the British Empire in Africa, "Wah-Wah" observes the disintegration of the Compton family through the eyes of its young son, Ralph (Zachary Fox and, later, Nicholas Hoult). When Harry Compton (Gabriel Byrne) learns that his high-strung wife, Lauren (Miranda Richardson), has run off with his best friend, he dives into a bottle, emerging just long enough to marry a free-spirited American stewardess named Ruby (Emily Watson).  While Ruby and Lauren come and go in Harry's increasingly dysfunctional life, Ralph eases the emotional strain with a part in the amateur production of "Camelot" that the colonials are staging in honor of an impending visit from Princess Margaret. Independence looms for their  country,  Swaziland, but "Wah-Wah" — Ruby's phrase for the expats' silly slang — pushes race to the fringes and nonwhites into supporting domestic roles. In this movie  the political is never permitted to intrude upon the personal.  In his writing and directing debut, the actor Richard E. Grant examines the pungent details of his own childhood in Swaziland, vividly recreating a community steeped in boredom, booze and casual adultery. Yet for all its studied snobbery and brittle entitlement, the film is never mean-spirited: even Ralph's monstrous parents are treated with more compassion than they deserve. Clearly, Mr. Grant's memories are more fond than bitter — even if the same probably can't be said of the Swazis.  "Wah-Wah" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Mildly offensive language, inoffensive sex and cringe-worthy British behavior.</text>
