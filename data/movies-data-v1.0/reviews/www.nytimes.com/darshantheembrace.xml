      <text> Less a documentary than an act of worship, “Darshan: The Embrace” is a glowing introduction to the life and work of Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, the so-called hugging saint. Recognized worldwide for her spiritual and humanitarian work, Amma, as she’s more commonly known, ministers to the poor of India with food and open arms, often for more than 20 hours at a stretch.  Jan Kounen’s awestruck film follows the mahatma from one jampacked event to another, eavesdropping as she offers advice on everything from caring for a skin condition to the correct way to feed an elephant. (The elephant, unbelievably, looks ecstatic.)  Mr. Kounen, who is Dutch, wants everyone to share his captivation: watching the white-garbed faithful line up by the thousands for a smile and a cuddle, his camera is guilty of lingering on the faces of the beautiful. Abundant shots of lush foliage, pastel-toned rooftops and sizzling sunsets are also a far cry from the images of Indian deprivation we’re accustomed to seeing on the news.  Yet this sincere and tranquil film reveals little of the woman beneath the halo. Photographs and film of the young Amma — whose family believed her to be mad — are few and fleeting, leaving a movie long on adulation but short on specifics. (Who, for instance, finances her extensive charity work, including millions of dollars to the victims of the 2004 tsunami?) Filling our heads with pretty pictures and not much else, “Darshan: The Embrace” is likely to leave audiences enchanted but unenlightened.</text>
