      <text> "Pride," about a swim coach (Terrence Howard) leading an urban  recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, illustrates the adaptability and limitations of the sports movie.  The film is based on fact: Mr. Howard's character, Jim Ellis, coached generations of African-American teenagers in competitive swimming in Philadelphia.  The film's director, a Zimbabwean, Sunu Gonera, pours on the period details: plaid shirts, Afros and Nixon-era street slang ("Jive turkey!"); a soundtrack featuring the O'Jays, the Staple Singers, the Philadelphia All-Stars and other Philadelphia R&amp;B legends.  Most striking is the film's depiction of a more blatant version of racism.  A prep school athletic director (Tom Arnold) flatly denies the hero a job on the basis of his race; later, when Jim takes his swimmers to the racist coach's suburban turf, white onlookers taunt them and boo their every mistake.  Otherwise, "Pride" is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. Stock elements include a saintly, tough-love coach; an outwardly cynical lieutenant (Bernie Mac) who is a closet idealist; and a naysayer (Kimberly Elise as a budget-cutting councilwoman) who is converted by the hero's sexy decency.  The team includes a reformed delinquent, a bespectacled nerd and a stuttering angel. The movie serves up the expected ratio of setbacks to triumphs and closes with video footage of the real Jim Ellis.  But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of "I'll Take You There," the heart still leaps.    "Pride" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, mild profanity and racist behavior.</text>
