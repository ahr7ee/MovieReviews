      <text> Herbie Hancock, the renowned jazz musician, has adapted to changing times by continually seeking out and embracing new challenges. For his latest album, "Possibilities," which was released last summer, he invited a variety of pop artists from all over the map, stylistically and geographically, to lend their talents.  Cutting from studio scenes to the occasional live performance and regularly employing  close-up and split-screen, Doug Biro and Jon Fine's documentary portrays the intense collaborative efforts that went into each track in a way that is both intimate and far reaching. (The film will be released on DVD by Magnolia Pictures on Tuesday.)  Christina Aguilera sets the film off on a slightly flat note because of her complete lack of charisma, but makes up for it with a voice of gold. And the artists that follow, including John Mayer, Sting, Carlos Santana and Annie Lennox, are engaging enough to carry movies of their own. (The only one who is out of place is Gina Gershon, who plucks on  a jew's-harp during the end credits.)  Even though the gifted performers occasionally borrow the spotlight, the true star always remains Mr. Hancock, a longtime practitioner of Buddhism who  encourages his adoring colleagues to journey beyond their "comfort zones," resulting in some interactions and freestyle jamming that are truly infectious.</text>
