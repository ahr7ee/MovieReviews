      <text> A maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid, “Princesas” is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa.  The princesses of the title — and what a facile conceit that is — are Caye (Candela Peña), a mousy Spaniard saving up for breast implants, and Zulema (Micaela Nevárez), a foxy Dominican saving money to send back home. They will bond and squabble over the course of the film, in which narrative drive is replaced by an episodic drip of breakdowns, soul searching, girly behavior (shopping, gossip, hairdressing) and improbable poetic monologues.  Mr. Aranoa is good with actors but lousy with ideas, though he broaches themes of class conflict and the economic basis of racism. His best material  observes the rivalry between a clique of native working girls and the dark-skinned streetwalkers newly arrived on the scene. Otherwise, “Princesas” rehearses “hooker with a heart of gold” tropes and indulges Almodóvarian clichés of Spanish spunk and solidarity.  Irrelevant subplots burden the leads. Ms. Peña is saddled with a brittle, lonely mother. Ms. Nevárez fends off an abusive client. Both try hard to energize the material, but there’s only so much to be done under the guidance of a director whose imaginative limitations are suggested by his conception, offered in the press kit, of the Zulema character: “a princess in exile, sweet and swarthy, doomed daily by desperation to eat the bitter bread of banishment.</text>
