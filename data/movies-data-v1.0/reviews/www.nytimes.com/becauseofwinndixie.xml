      <text>ere it not for a couple of cars, a little girl's pink poodle backpack and a reference to eBay, "Because of Winn-Dixie" could easily be mistaken for a film set in the 1950's. It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker. Adapted from Kate DiCamillo's best-selling children's novel, this is the story of a girl, a dog, a single father and a circle of colorful supporting Southern characters. Opal Buloni (AnnaSophia Robb) is a very lonely 10-year-old since she and her father (Jeff Daniels), a preacher, have moved to Naomi, Fla., a town so small (or odd) that church services are held in a convenience store. So when Opal sees a scruffy dog loose in a Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, knocking down bumbling adults and scattering fruit everywhere in movie-clichï¿½ fashion, she claims the animal, names him for the place where they met and takes him home to the trailer park. Once Opal has Winn-Dixie at her side, she makes friends easily. They include the librarian (Eva Marie Saint), who tells a story about a bear stealing a copy of "War and Peace"; Gloria Dump (Cicely Tyson), known as the Witch but really just a nice blind woman who lives alone; and Otis (Dave Matthews, as in the Dave Matthews Band), a gentle young man with a guitar who gives Opal a job at Gertrude's Pet Store. Opal feels so empowered that she begins pressing her emotionally shut-down father to tell her more about her mother, who ran away seven years ago. The dog that plays Winn-Dixie is cute enough, so it seems believable that normally sullen churchgoers might be won over when he disrupts services during the hymn "Just as I Am." Opal explains: "He just don't know the words, is all. But he sure is moved by the spirit." Ms. Robb, 11, is charming, and "Because of Winn-Dixie" is a harmless, pleasant comic drama, but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric on the page take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film. Naomi is the home, for instance, of the Litmus Lozenge Company, now defunct, which made candy in which sorrow was an actual ingredient. A taste leads Opal to observe "how the sweet and the sad were all mixed up together." In this movie, so are the magic realism and the corn. "Because of Winn-Dixie" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity, grown-up discussions about alcohol and the brief illusion of a dog eating a live mouse.</text>
