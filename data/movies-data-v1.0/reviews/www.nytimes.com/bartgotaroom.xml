      <text>A teenage comedy with an old-fogy scent, “Bart Got a Room” moves to the rhythms of a big-band  soundtrack and a borscht-belt vibe. Aiming for John Hughes by way of Woody Allen, the writer and director, Brian Hecker, sweats to wring freshness from his partly autobiographical tale of senior prom disaster; but not even the lovingly rendered Sunshine State setting can energize a screenplay more antiquated than the extras who pad its corners. Our dateless centerpiece is Danny (Steven Kaplan), a trumpet-playing dweeb driven by postprom fondling fantasies and the embarrassingly frank advice of his divorced parents (Cheryl Hines and William H. Macy). But as Danny bungles his way through a stale sequence of potential-prom-partner encounters, the movie imprisons its talented cast (including Alia Shawkat as Danny’s overlooked soul mate and Brandon Hardesty as his worldly best friend) in roles that leave little room for anything but caricature. Filmed in Hollywood, Fla., where the director grew up surrounded by retirees,  “Bart Got a Room” almost redeems itself with knowing images of beachfront bandstands and pastel strip malls, early-bird restaurants and plastic-coated sofas. In a movie in which  even the youngsters feel pants-at-the-armpits old, five minutes with Jennifer Tilly arrive like a gift, reminding us that comedy without risk is as barren as a prom without a theme. “Bart Got a Room” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). William H. Macy simulates orgasm, and everyone else simulates comedy.</text>
