      <text> In "The Salon" the normally vivacious Vivica A. Fox seems as artistically depleted as her surroundings: an urban beauty shop where cutting hair and cutting remarks go hand in hand. As Jenny, the beleaguered owner of a Baltimore  beauty shop catering primarily to African-American women, Ms. Fox plays moderator to a relentless stream of high drama and low wit.  Written and directed by Mark Brown and based on Shelly Garrett's play "Beauty Shop," "The Salon" is a battlefield of finger-snapping, head-thrusting attitude. Packed with black stereotypes — the sassy stylist with the big mouth and even bigger, um, personality (Kym Whitley); the smooth ladies' man (Dondre Whitfield) — the movie strains to wring laughs from a premise already played out by the superior "Barbershop" films (also written, in part, by Mr. Brown) and the Queen Latifah vehicle "Beauty Shop" (no relation to Ms. Garrett's play). There's even a token white customer to provide horrified reaction shots as the stylists gleefully elaborate on the African-American way of child rearing. Let's just say there's a lot of "whuppin' " involved.  A tiresome blend of overacting and underwriting, "The Salon" moves from one predictable conversation to another — the lack of available black men, the wondrousness of Bill Clinton — without originality or comic rhythm. When your script can't even keep up with J.Lo's love life, you know you're in trouble.  "The Salon" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has crudeness, rudeness, gay bashing and extravagant hand gestures.</text>
