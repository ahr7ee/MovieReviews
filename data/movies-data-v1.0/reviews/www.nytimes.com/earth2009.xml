      <text> Leave it to Disney to make global warming as soothing as a full-body massage. In the grandiosely titled “Earth,” plundered largely from the BBC Natural History Unit’s magnificent “Planet Earth,” the filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield take the temperature of our planet and conclude that it is rising. Blame James Earl Jones’s insistently cozy narration if the film makes that elevation seem as natural a phenomenon as the turning of the tides.  But this is nature defanged and declawed for kiddie consumption, so the emphasis is on awwww-filled moments — mandarin ducklings flapping adorably from nest to forest floor, polar bear cubs slithering on ungainly paws — captured in spectacularly high definition. Even when the fangs are visible (a great white shark gobbling a sea lion in balletic slow motion) the blood is not, thanks to  tasteful and customer-sensitive editing. There are no creepy-crawlies on this earth.  Following the tilt of the planet from pole to pole, “Earth” records the expanding deserts and shrinking rainfalls with well-meaning diligence but without explanation. The plight of the thirsty African elephants (every dehydrated fold lovingly captured) and starving humpbacked whales seems as removed from human action as a solar eclipse.  As a result, you may leave the theater feeling as fuzzy — and ultimately as powerless — as those doomed polar bears.</text>
