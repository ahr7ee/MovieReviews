      <text> Manufactured controversy can drag audiences into theaters, but you need a real movie to keep them there. The promoters of “Color of the Cross,” a reimagining of Jesus’ final days with all the good bits left out, are making a big deal out of the relatively tame suggestion that Jesus was black.  Unfortunately, the film’s writer, director and star, Jean-Claude LaMarre, never develops this merely novel idea into an intriguing and potentially explosive one. Though racial comments are scattered here and there — the Pharisees muttering about a “dark-skinned Nazarene” and Bethlehem innkeepers with a whites-only policy — the movie’s sole act of daring is an African-American King of the Jews. Oh, and a hot tent encounter between Judas and Mary Magdalene.  “Color of the Cross” aims to be “The Passion of the Christ,” minus the Passion. Literally. The film’s leap from Gethsemane to Calvary may confuse viewers not in on the story, but no more than its succession of eye-straining, candlelit interiors and reliance on stilted exposition.  Granted, Mr. LaMarre was not blessed with Mel    Gibson’s blood-and-thorns budget, but that’s no excuse for a camera    that moves with the sluggishness of a well-fed King Herod and dialogue (“Jews    — you cannot trust them!”) no self-respecting high school Christmas play would    tolerate. Though the film’s final, disturbing image forces race to the forefront    and belatedly raises wider issues of persecution, its most controversial suggestion    is not that Jesus might have been black but that he might have been a really    terrible actor.  “Color of the Cross” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lengthy crucifixion and a number of offensive accents.</text>
