      <text> Like Cluny Brown, Ernst Lubitsch’s tomboy heroine played by Jennifer Jones in 1946, Sydney White (Amanda Bynes) makes tool-wielding women sexy.  But that’s where the Lubitsch comparisons end, for there’s nothing sophisticated about the comedy in this peppy, ultra-P.C. variation on “Snow White.” Here Ms. White is a handy girl raised by her plumber father (the better-with-age John Schneider) who enrolls at her late mother’s alma mater, hoping to join the sorority Mom cherished.  But Sydney’s humble background and nonblond hair are just two indicators that she isn’t Greek sister material. After being rejected, she finds refuge at the Vortex, a ramshackle house inhabited by the seven biggest geeks  on campus. One’s bashful, another one’s sleepy ... you get the drift. Together they rally to steal the student body presidency from Sydney’s nemesis, Rachel, ahem, Witchburn (Sara Paxton), the still-pining ex of Sydney’s potential Prince Charming, Tyler, ahem, Prince (Matt Long), who’s as generic as his fairy-tale equivalents.  Perfectly slight, “Sydney White” is unlikely to muster the staying power of, say, “Revenge of the Nerds,” the raunchy underdog-power trailblazer from 1984. But Ms. Bynes, with her cherubic face, expressive eyes and comic timing, helps create a positive, pleasing diversion that caters to the geek in all of us.  “Sydney White” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some vaguely suggestive material and one record-breaking keg stand, but could easily pass for PG.</text>
