      <text>ine  is  more than a beverage.  It is, proverbially, the soul of a meal and, in some accounts, the very cornerstone of civilization, which is one of the reasons I prefer beer. Innocent talk of noses and finishes, therefore, has a way of  drifting toward headier matters.  Intoxicated though he is by the rolling, hilly landscapes of Napa, Tuscany and Languedoc,  Jonathan Nossiter, in his new documentary, "Mondovino," is more interested in the sobering facts of global marketing, economic competition and cultural imperialism. As it has made its way across Europe (after being shown at the Cannes Film Festival last spring), "Mondovino" has trailed controversy behind it, and the debate is likely to continue now that it has arrived in this country.  Part of what it is about, after all, is the cultural tension between the new world and the old - between crusty, fatalistic French peasants and smooth-faced, forward-looking Californians. In many ways, the battle being played out in the vineyards -  between European (but especially French) particularism and a global consumerism driven by American ideas about marketing and brand awareness -  echoes other, similar skirmishes; for instance, about movies themselves. At times, the quarrel pitting partisans of "terroir"  -  that mysterious sensory quality by which wine supposedly evokes the climate and history of its place of origin -  against the proponents of an equally mysterious process called micro-oxygenation, recalls the rhetorical warfare of the French "cin�ma des auteurs" against the blockbuster mentality of Hollywood. But in wine, as in movies, things are not so black (or do I mean red?) and white. Some of the most energetic proponents of vino-globalization (mondovinismo?) are French, many of them concentrated in Bordeaux. One of the film's most flamboyant figures -  and perhaps its designated villain -  is Michel Rolland, a fast-moving consultant who motors around the countryside in a chauffeured sedan, cigarillo and cellphone in hand, preaching the gospel of new oak and big flavor. Among his allies are the Mondavi family of California and the well-known wine critic Robert Parker, whose ratings allegedly have the power to propel some wines to international prestige. Arrayed against these avatars of jet-set, high-end wine marketing are stubborn, old-style growers like Hubert de Montille, a marvelously cranky philosopher of the grape, and Aim� Guibert, who declares that "wine is dead" but nonetheless revels in his successful crusade to prevent the Mondavis from developing some land near his vineyards. Mr. Nossiter covers a lot of ground, roaming from Bordeaux to Napa, from Sardinia to South America. He is an enthusiastic interviewer, proficient in several languages and able to put people at ease with his air of smiling, unassuming curiosity. His editing style is less ingratiating, though, as he repeats the same points over and over and stacks the deck to suit his political   assumptions. One of his favorite ploys is to scan the walls behind his interlocutors' heads for an incriminating detail, which usually takes the form of a signed picture of Ronald Reagan. The ideological subtext of "Mondovino" is perhaps more complex than Mr. Nossiter would allow, but there is no doubt that wine talk can become pretty heated. Mr. Parker, who views himself as a plain-spoken American democrat, is among the least inflammatory. Others indulge in unapologetic hyperbole. "It's not the traditionalists versus the modernists," says Neal Rosenthal, a New York importer who decries the "Napaization" of the world's vintages. "It's the collaborators against the resistance." Not to be outdone, a Bordeaux executive refers to Mr. Rosenthal's ilk as "ayatollahs of terroir." Tim Mondavi makes much of the fact that the mayor who stopped the Mondavi family's project in Mr. Guibert's neighborhood was a Communist. He does not mention that the man's predecessor, who supported the project, was a Socialist. The glorious history of the French left, it seems, has come to this: a Socialist is someone who supports transnational investment, while a Communist intervenes to protect the interests of landowners. Vive la diff�rence. Mr. Nossiter's presentation takes at face value Mr. de Montille and Mr. Guibert's view that they represent authenticity and tradition against crass consumerism, and it is possible to sympathize without being entirely persuaded. An interview with Michael Broadbent, a London auctioneer with a chalk-striped suit and an accent out of P. G. Wodehouse, recalls that the prestige of first-growth French wine arose in an earlier era of marketing and international trade, albeit one that was much more restricted. One of the unexamined ironies of this smart, sincere and sloppy film is its assumption that the tastes of the imperial British aristocracy of the 19th century were not only superior to those of the 21st-century American middle class but also friendlier to the enduring values of civilization. I don't know much about wine, but to me that leaves a funny aftertaste. "Mondovino" is rated PG-13 (Parental guidance suggested), for strong language and scenes of wine drinking.</text>
