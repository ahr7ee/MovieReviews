      <text>ane Fonda's duplicitous character in "Monster-in-Law" mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid any possible offense that it flees in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. Her screen alter ego, Viola Fields, is a Los Angeles television interviewer of Barbara Walters stature, who goes bonkers and lands in rehab after she is unceremoniously put out to pasture by her youth-obsessed network bosses. Foremost on Viola's list of obsessions is her determination to derail the marriage-bound relationship of her beloved only son, Kevin (Michael Vartan), a handsome surgeon, to Charlotte, a k a Charlie (Jennifer Lopez), a spunky office temp and part-time caterer and dog walker whom Viola considers unworthy of her darling boy. Ravenously biting into her first screen role in 15 years, Ms. Fonda plays Viola in the only way that makes sense, as a self-mocking, comic caricature of the same conflicted personality the actress reveals in her autobiography, "My Life So Far." The role throws crumbs to Ms. Fonda's fans (Viola is a serious, venerated journalist, staunch feminist and ageless beauty on a first-name basis with many world leaders), and slices of cake to her detractors (professionally unmoored, Viola morphs into a bitter, psychopathic control freak and vicious snob). The movie's portrait of an older, unmarried career woman who, having run through four husbands, is pathetically clawing for exclusive possession of a young man who happens to be her son is a demented nightmare vision of modern maturity; one step further and we would be in "Sunset Boulevard" territory. Winking broadly every step of the way, Ms. Fonda infuses her disagreeable character with a zany, good-natured verve that makes Viola palatable even when she is behaving atrociously, which is much of the time. Although the star carries off this balancing act, you have to wonder why Ms. Fonda decided to choose for her return to the screen a comedy so one-dimensional and craven that it makes "Meet the Parents" look avant-garde. Directed by Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde," "Win a Date With Tad Hamilton") from a screenplay by Anya Kochoff, "Monster-in-Law" has just enough laughs (three or four is all it takes nowadays) to make it a likely box-office success. The nerviest joke comes early in the movie, just after the ax has fallen on Viola, when in her final television interview she angrily grills an air-headed Britney-Jessica-Lindsay-Hilary clone. The teenage chirper, when asked what she thinks of Roe v. Wade, replies that she doesn't follow boxing. Viola goes ballistic and lunges at her throat. "Monster-in-Law" suggests that the time has come for Ms. Lopez to abandon romantic comedy for something edgier. At 35, she is too long in the tooth to keep playing Jenny From the Neighborhood, a blushing blue-collar ingï¿½nue tapped to be Cinderella. As she ambles joylessly through the role of Charlie, her heart is obviously not in it. Prince Charming, when first glimpsed jogging on the beach, causes Charlie to gasp with longing, although the couple, when they finally smooch, exhibit no romantic chemistry. A typical modern Hollywood prince, Kevin is a cipher with a cleft chin, carefully groomed stubble and flashy teeth. In the one bizarre instance where he shows signs of a personality, Kevin falls to his knees and proposes marriage during the initial meeting of his sweetheart and his mom. The movie would like to imagine that this Right in Front of Mommy business is cute; to me, it looks sick. In her campaign to destroy Charlie, Viola throws a fancy party engineered to reveal Charlie as a peasant who looks foolish to royalty. When the plan fails, Viola fakes a nervous breakdown, barges into Charlie and Kevin's love nest (while Kevin's away), and tries to drive Charlie crazy with her histrionic neediness. But Charlie quickly catches on to Viola's scheme and fights back. As the two women do battle over clothes, recipes and wedding plans, each plays dirty tricks on the other. Viola has Charlie secretly investigated (Cinderella, of course, is beyond reproach), while Charlie doses Viola with a heavy tranquilizer. Their conflict culminates with a bout of face slapping that offers no comic release, because  the skirmishes preceding it are so petty. You long for the kind of scary domestic battles waged in "The War of the Roses," a comedy that went over the top in the best way. Late in the game, Elaine Stritch drops in to the movie as Viola's horrifying mother and role model for domestic terrorism. If "Monster-in-Law" had a mind and a modicum of courage, it wouldn't run away from the issues of class, ethnicity and age built in to its scenario. The movie's voice of semi-truth belongs to Wanda Sykes, as Viola's wisecracking, not-too-loyal assistant, Ruby. Although Ms. Sykes gives her classic Thelma Ritter role a sassy comic bite, the character's seen-it-all cynicism is diluted with a spoonful of sugar. "Monster-in-Law," despite Ms. Fonda's animated comic presence, is a shrunken, cowardly movie in deep denial of its true nature, which is far uglier than it is ever willing to admit. "Monster-in-Law" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language.</text>
