      <text> In the course of his senior year at Coney Island's Lincoln High School, the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair will have to choose between the University of Louisville or the uncertainty of the N.B.A. draft. Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary "Through the Fire" is a record of that year, a sponsor-friendly profile (the film is produced by ESPN Original Entertainment) of an 18-year-old on whose shoulders rest the hopes of nine siblings and an exhausted mother. With nearly unlimited access to games, practice sessions, coaches and family members, Mr. Hock shows us a smart and frighteningly level-headed young man as he negotiates perhaps the most critical crossroads of his life.  Yet as Sebastian overcomes injury and a fickle press to make the cover of Sports Illustrated and shop for a dreamed-of Rolex, it becomes clear that the benefits of a college education pale when compared  with multimillion-dollar endorsement deals and escape from the violence of the projects. Behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs of "Through the Fire" lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent.  "I'm not used to being around people who have jobs," says Sebastian at one point, but the beaming Adidas executives at the announcement of his endorsement contract already know that. If he were, "Through the Fire" might never have been made.</text>
