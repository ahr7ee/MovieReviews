      <text> In the grand-scale animated comedy-adventure “Open Season,” periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D Imax version, can’t disguise that this is just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated  animals with little new to say.  Here, Boog (voiced by Martin Lawrence), a lovable and slightly dopey grizzly bear pampered by a kindly park ranger since cubhood, is set free in the wilderness just days before hunting season begins.  Tagging along is Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), the needy, motormouthed mule deer Boog rescues from the evil hunter Shaw (Gary Sinise). Elliot’s  mischievous ways are contagious. (Most disastrously  he gets Boog to help him ransack a convenience store while they’re both high on sugar.)  Despite some slow stretches, the usual morals  and the forgettable Paul Westerberg tunes, there are probably enough action-packed animal-versus-hunter battles and gross-out gags (very little time elapses between the mention, or appearance, of one bodily function or fluid and another) to keep the kiddies amused.  Adults won’t be so lucky. For best effect they should imagine that they’re watching a sequel to “Bambi,” and that Boog and Elliot’s oddball army of rabbits, beavers, skunks, squirrels, deer, a porcupine and a dachshund are taking revenge on the hunters responsible for the traumatic murder of Bambi’s mother. This bit of fantasy won’t necessarily make “Open Season,” the first feature from Sony Pictures Animation, an enjoyable experience,  but it might make it a slightly more satisfying one.  “Open Season” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some crude humor and generally playful animal abuse.</text>
