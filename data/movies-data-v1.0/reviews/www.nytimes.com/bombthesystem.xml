      <text>dam Bhala Lough's hot little melodrama "Bomb the System" visually rhapsodizes the lives of contemporary graffiti artists in a rich, bleeding-at-midnight palette that blurs the line between film and the illegal public art practiced by its young, alienated characters. As they furtively slap their pseudonyms onto the walls and bridges of Lower Manhattan, the splendid cinematography by Ben Kutchins evokes a downscale New York answer to the icy Los Angeles noir of Michael Mann, but on a minuscule budget and with passion to spare. The movie sustains a vision of Lower Manhattan as a delirious phantasmagoria; its crowning glory, the Brooklyn Bridge, looms out of the shadows, the ultimate magnet for an egotist longing to stamp his identity on a monument. The movie runs on the synergy between this grimy but glamorous urban landscape and the emotional intensity of characters who at moments suggest contemporary descendants of the innocent, tormented teenagers in "Rebel Without a Cause." The James Dean character, 19-year-old Anthony (Mark Webber), is an ambitious young artist who dreams of "bombing" the city of New York - that is, covering its every available surface with his and friends' graffiti signatures. The movie conveys plenty of information and insider argot about the rituals of bombing, including the fact that a graffiti artist in search of subculture stardom never buys his spray paint; it must be stolen. The story baldly reworks the clichï¿½ of the troubled young idealist torn between a dangerous, semioutlaw existence and the pursuit of a secure career track (in this case, via art school in San Francisco). The struggle pits Anthony's mother, Diane (Donna Mitchell), with whom he lives, against his posse of sweet but lost spray-can-wielding pals. Anthony's older brother (and idol) already died during a "bombing" expedition, and his mother is desperate not to lose her other son. Somewhere in the middle stands Anthony's girlfriend, Alexandra (Jaclyn DeSantis), whose own posse of political artists go around putting up illegal posters that read "Warning: This is a Police State." Alexandra wants Anthony to join them when they go on the road. Anthony's graffiti name is BLEST. Those of his closest friends, Justin Broady (Gano Grills) and Justin's younger brother Kevin (Jade Yorker), are BUK 50 and LUNE. Together they play cops and robbers with the Vandal Squad of the New York Police Department. The cops mean business. Kevin, only 16, has already had a run-in with the police, who drove him to New Jersey, beat him up and abandoned him there. When a police car driven by two officers in the Vandal Squad is defaced while they duck into a store, it's only a matter of time before there's a violent showdown. "Bomb the System," which rides on a subtle hip-hop soundtrack, might be described as soulful pulp; cult recognition awaits it. "Bomb the System" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and sexual situations and some violence.</text>
