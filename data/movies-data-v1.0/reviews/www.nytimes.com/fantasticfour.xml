      <text> If you like your special effects- driven summer action blockbusters slick, seamless and state of the art, then "Fantastic Four" may not be for you. While the superpowers and their consequences - flames, stretchy limbs, force fields and so on - no doubt required a great deal of money and expertise to bring to the screen, they look cheap and cheesy. Which may be the point. In an era when movies based on comic books have become increasingly solemn and serious, this one is content to be trashy. Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of "Batman Begins," "Fantastic Four" is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential. It is not an allegory, an archetypal tale of good and evil, or the cinematic equivalent of a graphic novel. It's a comic book.  And a venerable one at that, since it was the Four, back in 1961, who helped to put Marvel Comics on the map, making the world safe for Spiderman, the Hulk, the X-Men and the whole Marvel stable of introspective genetic anomalies. The group's movie debut is a standard origin story, in which the characters acquire and master their powers and confront their nemesis, one Dr. Doom. With its clumsy rhythms and indifferent acting, the movie, directed by Tim Story ("Barbershop") from a script by Mark Frost and Michael France, is more like a television pilot than a big-screen epic, and its sequels would probably play best in half-hour increments on Saturday morning.  These days, though, television is probably too smart for a lowest-common-denominator product like "Fantastic Four," which is fantastic only in its commitment to mediocrity. If the filmmakers are trying for a spoofy, light-hearted tone, they succeed only to the point of making the picture unintentionally funny. When Jessica Alba first appears on screen, introduced as Sue Storm, an M.I.T.-trained scientist who specializes in genetic research, the audience may snicker. But really, Ms. Alba - who has certainly made the most of her own genetic advantages - is no more laughable in such a role than Ioan Gruffudd, who does his best to achieve the emotional depth and physical grace of a plastic action figure. Mr. Gruffudd plays Reed Richards, a genius who has lost  the financing for his pet project, which involves both space travel and DNA sequencing.  Reed and Sue are former college sweethearts, but she is now involved with (and employed by) Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), a megalomaniacal tycoon who agrees to finance Reed's research. The three of them, along with Reed's pal Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Sue's reckless brother, Johnny (Chris Evans), spend a few moments on Victor's space station shouting nonsensical jargon  until a radioactive storm cuts the mission short. Back on Earth, they discover some unusual side effects. Reed's hair turns silver at the temples, and the rest of his body takes on the qualities of a rubber band; Johnny, on a snowboard run that is the film's best and most gratuitous action sequence, bursts into flame; Ben acquires Herculean strength and grows a stony carapace that sends his fianc√©e running in the other direction. (Later, she shows up on the Brooklyn Bridge, where the Four have made their daring-rescue debut, to return Ben's engagement ring. Luckily, a friendly blind woman, played by Kerry Washington, soon sees the appeal of a big, stony, four-fingered guy in a raincoat and baggy pants).  Sue, for her part, is able to make herself  invisible, and to generate powerful protective force fields, gifts that might serve Ms. Alba well in real life. Oddly enough, once the process of superpower acquisition is complete, very little remains for the superheroes, or the movie, to do. Ben - also known as The Thing - is the only one who suffers the kind of identity crisis that sometimes haunts sensitive superheroes, and Mr. Chiklis, under 60 pounds of latex, gives the most affecting performance in the movie. The others read their lines and stand around waiting for the special effects to kick in, and for the villain to work out his  identity crisis and drop the "Von" from his name. Apparently, Spiderman has already taken care of street crime, and the only non-Doom-related do-gooding to be done is a bit of suicide-prevention, which leads to further rescue opportunities. After that, the only thing left is to look at your watch and count the minutes until the sequel, or the next comic-book blockbuster.  "Fantastic Four" is rated PG  (Parental guidance suggested). It has some rough action sequences and a few half-naughty innuendoes.</text>
