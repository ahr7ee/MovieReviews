      <text>he events in "Nina's Tragedies," a flighty Israeli film that takes whimsical tangents into the absurd, spring from entries in a secret journal kept by Nadav (Aviv Elkabets), a glum, bespectacled 14-year-old boy with a dirty mind. As the movie gyrates between comedy and pathos, it toys with magic realism that never bursts into full-flowered surrealist fantasy. "Nina's Tragedies" wobbles along unsteadily, like the gurney with a squeaky wheel that carries a body to its burial in the film's rain-drenched opening scene. Nadav is besotted with his mother's beautiful, high-strung sister, Nina (Ayelet July Zurer), who is unexpectedly widowed when her new husband, Haimon (Yoram Hatav), is killed in a terrorist attack. Ms. Zurer, whose blend of beauty and spirited eccentricity suggests an Israeli answer to Diane Keaton, is the steadiest light illuminating a film that takes in the topsy-turvy world of contemporary Tel Aviv through an adolescent's distracted glances. The relationship between Nadav and his aunt is stormy and one-sided. She loves him but is so rapt in her own turmoil that she remains unaware of his passion. Nadav's heavy-breathing journal is not his only personal secret. With his friend Menahem (Dov Navon), who must be at least a decade older, he embarks on Peeping Tom expeditions. The movie never questions this relationship, nor does it bother to explain how and when this unlikely pair of voyeurs joined forces. If their perverse partnership is a metaphor for the disorder of urban Israeli life in an atmosphere of siege, it doesn't register very strongly. Nadav's mother, Alona (Anat Waxsman), is a tempestuous, sexually free-spirited fashion designer estranged from her religious husband, Amnon (Shmil Ben-Ari), who is dying of emphysema. The main strand of the movie follows Nina's impulsive marriage and wrenching plunge into widowhood as observed through Nadav's overheated gaze. Some weeks after Haimon's funeral, she has an impulsive one-night stand with Avinoam (Alon Aboutboul), the photographer who notified her of her husband's death. After his night in heaven, Avinoam, a silver-tongued romantic with serious boundary issues, is ready to shuck his fiancï¿½e, a successful artist, and spend his life with Nina. But she is guilt-stricken and refuses to see him again. The boy, identifying with both Haimon and Avinoam, imagines himself betrayed by his aunt and suspends their friendship, much as she cut off her new lover. She, in turn, begins having visions of her late husband peering accusingly through her bedroom window. One afternoon, she sees him running naked down the street. But are these sightings hallucinations? Or is there a Haimon look-alike streaking around Tel Aviv? The biggest weakness in "Nina's Tragedies," which won 11 Israeli Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best screenplay, is the character of Nadav. Even with his adolescent obsessions, he remains a poker-faced cipher, darting from one scene to the next without emerging as either a person or a coherent point of view. His shadowy presence leaves the movie without a solid center around which to spin its tales.</text>
