      <text> Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of several “Saw” sequels, has devised an excruciating new torture with “Repo! The Genetic Opera.” Set about 50 years hence, this high-concept, tone-deaf musical imagines a dystopian society afflicted by widespread organ failure, biological black markets and spontaneous outbreaks of painfully monotonous rock ’n’ roll.  Adapted from a theater production with lyrics and music by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, “Repo!” feels destined to please a campy coterie of fans and no one else. Granted, there is a measure of originality in conceiving a horror-inflected rock opera on scientific and political themes, and no film starring Paris Hilton as a marginalized heiress whose poorly grafted face slides clean off her skull is entirely without its guilty pleasures.  But when you live by the song,  you die by the song. A few catchy melodies, some clever lyrics or even a sense that the score wasn’t just one long, unmodulated track might have energized this singularly inert tale of a young girl (Alexa Vega) seeking answers to the nature of her peculiar genetic disease and the strange history of  an Orwellian biotech firm named GeneCo.  “Repo! The Genetic Opera” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence.</text>
