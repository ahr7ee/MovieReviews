      <text> A minimum-wage comedy with minimum-talent stars, “Employee of the Month” chronicles the rocky romance of two drones working for a Costco-like megastore. Zack (Dane Cook) is a slacker box boy who lives with his potty-mouthed grandmother (Barbara Dodd Ramsen) and plays Texas hold ’em instead of, well, boxing things. Amy (Jessica Simpson) is the bodacious new cashier whose virtue is reputedly available only to employee-of-the-month title holders. And they say there are no good roles for women these days.  Directed by Greg Coolidge with the flair of a training video, “Employee of the Month” turns work into a game and love into a sporting event. Competing against Zack for both the coveted title and Amy’s affections is the store’s odious head cashier, Vince (Dax Shepard), a k a “the fastest hands in the Southwest” (a moniker guaranteed to pique the interest of any young woman). As Zack and Amy bond over their physical idiosyncrasies — he has a tongue that could audition for Cirque du Soleil, she has ears like an African elephant — Vince and his faithful sidekick (Efren Ramirez) bicker like Gable and Lombard. Movies like this tend to believe a villain with repressed homosexual urges is much funnier than one without.  Replete with loser buddies, limp subplots and a dwarf named Glen Ross (Danny Woodburn), “Employee of the Month” is more tired than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. One can only hope its halfhearted suggestion that winning isn’t everything is some comfort if the movie’s grosses are as disappointing as its jokes.  “Employee of the Month” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has bad words, bad acting and bad worker attitudes.</text>
