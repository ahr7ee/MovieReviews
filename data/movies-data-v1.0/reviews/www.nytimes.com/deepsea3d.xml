      <text> The infinite wonders of ocean life never cease to amaze, Imax technology continues to advance and, lucky for us, Howard Hall, a longtime underwater explorer and cinematographer, is there to weave the best of both worlds into one package, gargantuan in scope yet compact in time. Clocking in at 39 minutes, which may be about all the eyes can handle, "Deep Sea 3D"  transports exotic sea species literally to our noses. Hundreds of translucent jellyfish, the once-a-year spawning of coral and  much-needed visits to a cleaning station by scummy-looking fish are just a few of the sights to marvel at in Mr. Hall's fourth Imax film, while more villainous creatures like manta rays, sharks and squid swim dangerously close, daring you to keep those 3D glasses on.  The soothing voices of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide the informative yet often uninspired narration. And Danny Elfman's mystical sounds serve up just the right atmosphere for this almost complete immersive experience, during which adults will be made into giggling children, and children into aspiring marine biologists. But until technology wizards develop a way to make audience members invisible, viewers will periodically be pulled out of the film, left to wonder why the guy in front of them is wearing a massive sea turtle on his head.  "Deep Sea 3D" is rated G. </text>
