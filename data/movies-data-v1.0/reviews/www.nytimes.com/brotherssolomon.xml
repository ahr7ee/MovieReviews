      <text> The spirit of Steve Martin’s early hit-or-miss slapstick oddities lives on in “The Brothers Solomon,” a crass goof in which two socially inept siblings, John and Dean Solomon (Will Arnett and Will Forte), who were home-schooled in the Arctic by their now comatose dad (Lee Majors), try to fulfill his wish for a grandchild.  Sexually inexperienced and repellently awkward, the two  have  no choice but to opt for artificial insemination. The surrogate mother, Janine (Kristen Wiig of “Saturday Night Live”), views the task as a job at first; but soon enough,  biological feelings  take over. When the delivery date looms and   she disappears,     the brothers embark on a panicked chase across Southern California.  The film’s screenwriter, Mr.  Forte, and its director, Bob Odenkirk (formerly of HBO’s sketch comedy series “Mr. Show”), have fashioned a deranged, sometimes desperate parody of an inspirational losers-make-good comedy. Three gags miss for every one that hits.  But the good ones are keepers: Janine patiently telling the brothers what artificial insemination means, stressing “artificial”; Janine’s menacing but devoted boyfriend (Chi McBride) weeping with rage upon meeting John and Dean; John’s lame dream of a hot-tub encounter with a blond fantasy object named Tara (Malin Akerman), a neighbor and sometime caretaker to their dad, which climaxes with Tara bolting and John ecstatically kissing her wet footprint to the tune of “Almost Paradise.”  “The Brothers Solomon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and sexual content.</text>
