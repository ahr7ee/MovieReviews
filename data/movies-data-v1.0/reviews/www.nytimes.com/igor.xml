      <text> In the Kingdom of Malaria, inky clouds obscure the sun and loony scientists are rewarded for diabolical inventions. There’s scant reward, though, for sitting through “Igor,” an animated twist on the Frankenstein story that never sparks to life.  Combining genetics, Aldous Huxley and horror-movie history, the film’s scientists have engineered a servile class of hunchbacks, all named Igor. When one of these sorry creatures (voiced by John Cusack) succeeds in assembling a female monster — part Betty Boop, part Elephant Man — first place at the Evil Science Fair seems assured. If only she weren’t so gosh-darned nice.  As our Igor lurches toward love and a realignment of priorities, his progress is impeded by a Liberace-styled nemesis (Eddie Izzard, camping it up), a suicidal bunny (Steve Buscemi) and a dimwitted, jar-dwelling brain (Sean Hayes). Kiddies, however, will be undiverted by the humdrum animation and a palette that mirrors the film’s moral and meteorological gloom. Neither will they respond to a script (by Chris McKenna) that seems more focused on tickling movie-savvy adults: how many kindergartners recognize James Lipton?  Despite a soundtrack bobbing with the bawdy sentiments of Louis Prima, “Igor” leaves us unmoved by its vertically challenged hero. His belief that the ultimate evil is an excerpt from “Annie,” on the other hand, deserves our unqualified sympathy.  “Igor” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Characters wear boots made from baby seals and display a poster of tortured kittens.</text>
