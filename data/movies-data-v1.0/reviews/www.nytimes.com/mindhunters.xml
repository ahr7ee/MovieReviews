      <text>indhunters" is a quintessential Renny Harlin film: a big, dumb, loud action movie. Despite its reliable delivery of jarring plot twists and elaborately staged mayhem, it never quite manages - or, for that matter, tries - to transcend the genre of the B-list thriller. The director of such fare as "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master" seems most at home where Hollywood clichï¿½ shades into camp parody. The premise is a reimagining of Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians" (also known as "And Then There Were None") as Eight Little Profilers: a graduating class of would-be F.B.I. agents is plunked down on the fictional Oneiga Island, an isolated training compound. There they will spend the weekend profiling an imaginary killer known as the Puppeteer. Their mentor, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer, in one of the mad-genius roles that have become his specialty), has set up an eerie simulation of a crime scene as the site of the team's final exam. But when one team member dies in an unforeseeable (and utterly preposterous) fashion, it is clear that the killer they seek is among them, and that the only way off the island is to turn their profiling skills upon one another as the unseen predator picks them off in increasingly imaginative ways. Kathryn Morris, of television's "Cold Case," plays the closest thing the film can claim to a heroine, an insecure but ambitious young woman driven to succeed as an agent because of her sister's brutal murder as a child. (Many of the film's characters are provided with these conveniently traumatic back stories.) LL Cool J (working under his given name, James Todd Smith) has an elegant turn as a cop planted among the profilers for training purposes, but his character soon founders under the weight of implausible twists. Most of the other profilers, including the ringleader, J. D. (Christian Slater), are largely indistinguishable, serving as little more than walking targets for the next outlandish murder scheme. "Mindhunters" has been shelved for two years awaiting distribution by Dimension. Its muddy color palette and largely unknown cast give it the feel of a straight-to-video throwaway, but it may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. "Mindhunters" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, violence and graphic gore.</text>
