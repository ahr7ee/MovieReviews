      <text>teve McQueen and James Garner, who drove in the Baja 1000 off-road race way back when, are listed as making cameo appearances in "Dust to Glory," a proudly rowdy down-home documentary about the 2003 run. Those appearances consist of a brief, silent glimpse of Mr. Garner and what must be an even briefer one of Mr. McQueen, because I'm not absolutely sure I saw him. Dana Brown, who wrote and directed, is the son of the documentary filmmaker Bruce Brown and worked on "The Endless Summer II," his father's surfing sequel. The younger Mr. Brown's new film is  the product of real enthusiasm and may appeal to moviegoers who share his devotion to this dangerous  race, which runs the length of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, from Tijuana to La Paz. The event, first held in 1967, involves a wide variety of vehicles, including motorcycles, dune buggies, trophy trucks and unmodified pre-1982 Volkswagen Beetles. Judging from the comments of participants, the race's appeal seems to be the joy of telling stories about the ordeal later. One man, obviously an adrenaline addict, estimates that most people have 10,000 close calls in a lifetime, but anyone in this race has them all in one day, so that afterward "regular life feels like slow-motion." The racing champion Mario Andretti, grand marshal in 2003, does make a noteworthy appearance, and some of the race's old hands are interesting characters. J. N. Roberts, for instance, a winner of the first Baja 1000, is competing again at age 62. There is occasionally some gorgeous scenery, and the challenge of driving through silt is mildly interesting. (The secret of getting through it, they say, is never to let up on the gas.) "Dust to Glory" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some frightening driving and a spectator's accidental death.</text>
