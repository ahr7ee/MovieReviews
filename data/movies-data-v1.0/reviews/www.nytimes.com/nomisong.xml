      <text>he Nomi Song" chronicles the short and haunting life of Klaus Sperber, a trained classical singer from Essen, Germany, who came to New York as a young man in the late 1970's. Sperber took the name Nomi as part of his personal mythology, and soon caused a sensation on the underground art scene with his elfin, androgynous appearance, outrageous costumes and soaring countertenor voice. He concocted an extraordinary stage persona from fragments of 20th-century pop culture: postwar Berlin cabaret, 50's science fiction films and the emerging new wave in music and fashion. In 1978 Nomi made four now legendary appearances in a "New Wave Vaudeville" show at Irving Plaza, singing Saint-Saï¿½ns arias in a flawless falsetto while wearing Kabuki-like makeup and a see-through vinyl cape. Soon Nomi was the toast of downtown, appearing at sites like Max's Kansas City and making two pop records before his death of AIDS at 39 in 1983. In both his personal and professional life, Nomi remained an enigmatic, at times otherworldly figure. In a clip from a New York cable-access television show, he remains in character (not to mention costume and makeup) as he shows the audience how to bake his lime tart. (His famously delicious confections became currency in the barter between flat-broke artist types.) We see him singing backup behind David Bowie on "Saturday Night Live" in a performance so stylized that it still looks fresh two decades later. Perhaps because of the obsessive propensity of 80's urban scenesters to document their own lives on the emerging medium of video, Andrew Horn's documentary manages to tap into an unusually rich vein of archival material, from home movies to taped live performances to early music videos with hypnotically crude special effects. Mr. Horn also interviews some of Nomi's contemporaries, including the performance artist Ann Magnuson and the painter Kenny Scharf, who recalls living in a building that faced onto Nomi's apartment and hearing the singer's arias wafting through the courtyard on summer days.  "The Nomi Song" is an affectionate portrait, not only of Nomi, but also of the long-gone days when downtown Manhattan was an affordable enclave for creative misfits. The end of "The Nomi Song" is harrowingly sad, as at least three of Nomi's friends guiltily recall failing to visit him as he lay dying of the mysterious disease then known as "gay cancer.</text>
