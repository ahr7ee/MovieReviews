      <text>hen it comes to making movies, the English director Danny Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for "Trainspotting," a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, memorable for its E-is-for Ecstasy flourishes and the hallucinatory vision of a creepily crawling dead baby, and, more recently, for the shiver-filled zombie flick "28 Days Later," Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Mr. Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, and the enjoyment he appears to derive when push leads to shove in those stories, it may come as something of a surprise that the filmmaker has handily cleared a new hurdle: he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a lonesome little boy, a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational film debut), "Millions"is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination - not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought - takes boundless flight. Principally set in and around a new ticky-tacky housing development in an anonymous suburban wasteland, the story hinges on what happens - the good, the bad and the scary - after a sack stuffed with money literally lands on its 7-year-old hero. Along with his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), and father, Ronnie (James Nesbitt), Damian has moved into new digs, mostly, it seems, because their old home is where once upon a time they lived with a loving wife and mother. Recently deceased, the missing woman hangs over this woeful threesome like a sigh. Her absence shapes their days and nights, driving Ronnie to cuddle the pillows in his big empty bed and sending his children deep into worlds of their own making, one shaped by pre-adolescent tremors, the other by ecstatic faith. Mr. Boyle is a master of gimmicks, narrative and visual; like a good pop musician, he believes in the power of the hook, a catchy bit to reel you in.  With  "Millions," that catchy bit isn't the errant bag of cash or the stranger who, shades of "Great Expectations," ominously emerges from the wilds to haunt the boys and kick-start the plot. The hook is that  Damian believes he is on speaking (and seeing) terms with saints whose tribulations he knows the way most  children know the stats of their favorite football players. A gravely beautiful child, with a face splashed with freckles and pooling eyes, the young actor brings to the role the strange ethereality of those children who never fit in to the here and the now but curl into their own private worlds, giggling at jokes no one else hears. Happily for the film and its infectious sense of fun, the character is also a pip. Invariably the odd kid out, the one who clings to the schoolyard wall at recess while the rest of the gaggle scream and shout, Damian keeps us engaged less because he greets St. Peter like a long-lost relative, than because he registers as wonderfully real. After the bag falls from the sky, Damian brings the practically minded Anthony for a peek. "You can see it, too?" he anxiously asks of the loot. Damian may have an overactive imagination (then again, Mr. Boyle slyly suggests, maybe not), but he's also self-aware enough to know that St. Clare of Assisi, who drops by his cardboard playhouse to steal a smoke, is no ordinary imaginary friend. "Millions" was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, who has a raft of groaningly heavy credits to his name, including a handful of features directed by that other British film chameleon, Michael Winterbottom ("Butterfly Kiss," "The Claim"). That r�sum� may not inspire high hopes, but Mr. Boyce also wrote the psychologically pitch-perfect "Hilary and Jackie" and the eager-to-please "24 Hour   Party People"; the first showed he can do serious without succumbing to lugubrious,  while the second proves he knows how to laugh. His screenplay for "Millions" taps the writer's strengths and shows a rare respect for  pint-sized characters. One of the pleasures of the film is there's never any doubt that this soulful child feels as deeply as any adult: Damian may be a squirt, but he is also an existential hero. Much of the movie's other pleasures are visual. As he did in "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later," Mr. Boyle uses all manner of enjoyable tricks to show us what his characters see; more poignantly, he also shows why Damian takes such delight in being alive, despite his crushing loss. "Millions" has plenty of story and characters to chew over, including a sweetheart for Ronnie, Latter-day Saints and train robbers, a boogeyman and all those peripatetic martyrs. But more enjoyable still is a dream house that goes up lickety-split and clouds that scud overhead like bunnies. At the core of this unexpectedly moving film is a serious child (and just maybe a reformed cynic) who with heart and eyes open embraces a credo once spat out by an older, rather less wise soul in "Trainspotting": choose life. "Millions" is rated PG (Parental guidance is suggested). The loss of a mother may upset some children; the film also contains mild violence, adult language and the discreet suggestion of adult sexuality.</text>
