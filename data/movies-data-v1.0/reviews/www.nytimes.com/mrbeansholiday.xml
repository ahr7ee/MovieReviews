      <text> With “Mr. Bean’s Holiday,” the British comedian Rowan Atkinson continues a tradition that in the right hands — Buster Keaton, Jacques Tati,  even Jerry Lewis in “The Bellboy” — never gets stale: comic pantomime. Or, in this case, near-pantomime, since Mr. Atkinson, in a sequel 10 years after  “Bean,” speaks, but only rarely. He doesn’t have to. His googly eyes, gangly physique and elastic countenance are just fine for delivering the goods.  The plot is simplicity itself: Mr. Bean wins a ticket to the South of France;  train-station confusion results in the separation of a boy and his father;  and it’s up to Mr. Bean to reunite them. But not before he has demonstrated the range of his slapstick, against a sun-drenched, candy-colored French countryside. The whole escapade ends up at the Cannes Film Festival, where Willem Dafoe does an amusing turn as a vain director.  As the clumsy, sometimes mischievous but mostly well-intentioned title character, Mr. Atkinson essentially plays a child (in grown-up attire), which is only proper, given the audience this movie is squarely directed at. Yes, there are subtitles involved, but so what? The kids at my screening loved it. Besides, at its heart, Mr. Atkinson’s movie, a huge hit overseas, speaks in an international language.  MR.</text>
