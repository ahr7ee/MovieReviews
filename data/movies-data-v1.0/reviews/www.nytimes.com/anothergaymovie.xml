      <text> “Another Gay Movie” spoofs its way through a parody of teen sex comedies and equally formulaic gay coming-of-age flicks. Senior year at San Torum High School has just ended for all-American Andy (Michael Carbonaro), the jock hottie Jarod (Jonathan Chase), a nerd named Griff (Mitch Morris) and the fiercely flamboyant Nico (Jonah Blechman). Goaded by Muffler (Ashlie Atkinson), a brash lesbian lady killer who throws raucous parties at her fabulous apartment (the “maxi-pad”), the boys make a pact to  experience anal sex before college.  What follows is a rude, rollicking and exceedingly raunchy attempt to turn “American Pie” into “American Quiche.” The writer and director Todd Stephens works from a recipe  that calls for shooting fish in barrels, roasting them over flaming attitude and then garnishing with obscenity, vulgarity and naughty bits. This narrowest of niche movies is as broad as can be, whether the target is mainstream movie tropes (true love under your nose) or subculture types (drug-addled circuit queens, hardcore German bondage freaks).  Certain gags reach the laughing point through brazen bluntness or sheer histrionic determination. Others, like a repellent cameo by Richard Hatch, are merely desperate. Few can be described in a family newspaper.  What pleasure is to be had from the material —  the frank addressing of sexual anxiety and social pressure, a nicely built and frequently undressed cast —  is offset by a worldview that casts the lone African-American character as a libidinous go-go boy and finds it clever to provide subtitles for an Asian cheerleader speaking English. Skewering one status quo while pandering to another, “Another Gay Movie” is exactly what  its title presumes to subvert.</text>
