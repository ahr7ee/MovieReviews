      <text> Luridly earnest and laughably immoral, “Illegal Tender” is an old genre movie with a new look. Call it Hispanixploitation.  Placing all its faith in the formidable Wanda de Jesús as Millie, a pistol-packing mama whose violent past is nipping at her heels, the movie gives her a lavish Connecticut lifestyle (financed by her late husband’s drug money) and two oblivious sons. But when gangsters from the old neighborhood come calling, it’s up to the elder boy (Rick Gonzalez) to  protect the family unit.  This will require a trip to Puerto Rico, which is also an opportunity to pad the plot with jiggling behinds and strobe-lit bosoms. (Like most fictional drug lords, the villain here does all his business in a crowded nightclub.) But though Mr. Gonzalez does his best to appear threatening, his callow confrontations with the cream of Puerto Rico’s underworld are no more convincing than his mother’s twisted family values.  Written and directed by Franc. Reyes, “Illegal Tender” features telenovela dialogue (“He’s not bad news, Wilson, he’s the worst news there is”) and a surprisingly racist insinuation. “Dig deep enough into people’s lives and you’re gonna find stains,” says Millie at one point,  implying that all successful minorities prospered by dubious means. Not exactly a suggestion one expects from a John Singleton production.  “Illegal Tender” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has men in shades, women in heat and guns in closets.</text>
