      <text> With good taste and great speed, Isabella Stewart Gardner of Boston spent the last decade of the 19th century (and a very large inheritance) amassing first-rate European art. She opened her collection to the public in 1903, and when she died some 20 years later, left behind a will stipulating that no object ever be moved or replaced.  On March 18, 1990, two thieves disguised as Boston police officers ransacked the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of some of its most precious holdings: works by Manet, Degas, Flinck and Rembrandt. The theft of these treasures was a big loss to the small museum, but nothing compared with the jewel in its crown, "The Concert" by Vermeer, cut from its frame and missing to this day. It  may be the world's most expensive stolen painting. It is surely the most beloved.  Vermeer devotees, some with tears in their eyes, are among those interviewed in "Stolen," a documentary by Rebecca Dreyfus that recounts the Gardner theft and the efforts to retrieve its masterpieces. Rife with conspiracy and colorful characters, this globe-trotting intrigue has the makings of a splendid thriller, but Ms. Dreyfus has fashioned only a middling documentary, failing to locate a compelling structure or rhythm in the material.  She does, however, stumble onto a captivating hero in Harold Smith, a well-known art detective who investigates the Gardner theft. Spindly, perspicacious and wry, Mr. Smith cuts a dapper figure despite his face bandages and prosthetic nose, the accouterments of late-phase skin cancer. He suggests a cross between Sherlock Holmes, Ichabod Crane and the Phantom of the Opera, and recovers some interest for "Stolen.</text>
