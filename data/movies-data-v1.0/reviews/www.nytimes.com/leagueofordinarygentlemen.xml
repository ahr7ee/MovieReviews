      <text>League of Ordinary Gentlemen," an affectionate though unconvincing documentary, struggles to present professional bowling as a simpler, nobler pastime from a simpler, nobler time. But the film, like the sport itself, falters as it follows the words and deeds of its heroes: the bowling contests never seem to reach the level of other crowd-pleasing athletics, and too often,  the winners seem like losers. Take, for instance, Pete Weber, a coarse, mustachioed showman whose record of  toppling pins makes him  part of a proud dynasty. His father, Dick, was a mild-mannered champion of the previous generation of professional bowlers, and the film showcases this St. Louis family as if  it were the Bushes of these bush leagues. The son, like the president, is a reformed bad boy trying to do his prim father proud. The younger Weber's recent success, however, comes not so much through skill - though he does bowl enough strikes and spares to win tournaments - as through the successful marketing of himself as a camera-ready aggressor. He steps into the spotlight or celebrates a well-spun roll of the ball with his signature two-armed gesture, what he calls the "crotch chop." It's some weird backward bend that signals male bravado but that inadvertently winds up saying "look at me" and "laugh at me" at the same time. It occurs even to Mr. Weber that he needs a new shtick. In the film's setup, any such criticism of the sport and its blue-collar enthusiasts is deemed snobbish. The disbanding of bowling leagues and the darkening of many quaint lanes are blamed on the arrival of television, which sucked people out of nighttime public places and into spectator seats in their own living rooms. There, slicker packages of entertainment presumably spoiled some collective interest in this sport, but honestly, the film's big-tournament finale did not deliver any surprises, ï¿½ la "Spellbound," about how engrossing a presumably boring contest can be. It's a  pity, but for many people, bowling is the watched pot that never boils. Esteemed theorists like Robert Putnam contribute  sound bites; Mr. Putnam describes  his much-discussed "Bowling Alone" theory about such a dismantling of subcultures. Then, lesser experts, including the actor Timothy Busfield,  champion the average Joes of the sport. Wearing one of those two-tone shirts, Mr. Busfield addresses the camera while posing in front of the Stuckey Bowl set from the canceled NBC series "Ed";  thus, he comes off as the last baby boomer standing in a fizzled retro-chic fad. Perhaps the film's true hero is  Steve Miller, whom new investors enlist to restore the Professional Bowlers Association to some fiscal solvency and televised glory. He recruits ESPN, with its many hours to fill, and Odor-Eaters, with its endorsement dollars, even though that  sponsorship was first derisively suggested in the Farrelly brothers' mocking take on bowling, the movie "Kingpin." Mr. Miller's league is at least capitalizing on the insult. Mr. Miller uses profanity-filled chalk talks to rouse the bowlers into some telegenic fury, but they are too lumpen, inarticulate or broken by the pro league's sad downturn to lift the sport's,  or the film's, prospects. Directing his first feature, Christopher  Browne shows flair and determination in getting the movie's   pathos down pat,   but he can't quite find enough that is pleasurable in its many reels.</text>
