      <text>As most of us know only too well, our lives are ruled by the clock. In Marcos Siega’s “Chaos Theory,” Frank Allen (Ryan Reynolds), an uptight author and motivational speaker who teaches people how to utilize each minute efficiently, tries to overcome time’s tyranny by strictly following self-imposed schedules and lists. But the loss of 10 minutes after his wife, Susan (Emily Mortimer), playfully turns the clock back one morning sets off a chain of increasingly absurd events that forces him to reassess his domestic bliss; his caddish best friend, Buddy (Stuart Townsend);  and his approach to life in general. A predictable romantic dramedy that isn’t particularly tender, moving or amusing, “Chaos Theory” suffers first and foremost from featuring the least engaging couple to headline a movie in some time. If the bland Mr. Reynolds and the grating Ms. Mortimer are Hollywood’s idea of the latest in romantic leads, then we’re in trouble. The film is told mostly via flashback, as Frank recounts his woes to his soon-to-be son-in-law, and in its most embarrassing recollection a drunken Susan selects a husband from among her male friends based on their nicknames for their penises. Frank’s — “Truth” — wins out. Too bad there’s actually very little truth to be found in the film. “Chaos Theory” is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned) for slight sexual situations and language.</text>
