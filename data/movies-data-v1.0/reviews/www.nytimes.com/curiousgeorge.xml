      <text> In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, Curious George — or "the monkey," as he's called for the first two-thirds of this new animated film — doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture.  In fact, Curious George doesn't even talk. Instead, he makes cute chittering noises, eats bananas and peeks playfully from beneath the yellow hat belonging to his human companion, the Man in the Yellow Hat (here given a name, Ted, and voiced by Will Ferrell). In this film version of "Curious George," directed by Matthew O'Callaghan,  George is all monkey — a quality that will not only appeal to children, but will also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey and are not eager to see them turned into the slangy, ironic metacartoons now in fashion.  Ted, an earnest guide at the Bloomsberry Museum, heads to Africa in search of the long-lost idol of Zagawa. To his chagrin, the statue turns out to be tiny, and his hopes of saving the failing museum with a grand new acquisition are dashed. But unbeknownst to Ted, the baby monkey he befriended has followed him as a stowaway on the ship home.  George's mischievous antics soon get Ted fired from his job, much to the delight of his nemesis, Bloomsberry Jr. (David Cross), who dreams of seeing the museum turned into a parking lot. But after getting into and out of a few more scrapes, Ted and George manage both to salvage the museum and impress Maggie (Drew Barrymore), the elementary school teacher of Ted's dreams. With top-drawer voice talent including Joan Plowright and Dick Van Dyke, original songs by Jack Johnson, and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation that echoes the simple colors and shapes of the books, "Curious George" is an unexpected delight.</text>
