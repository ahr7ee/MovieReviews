      <text> See Bruno (Asa Butterfield). See Bruno run. See Bruno see a farm. See Bruno see “farmers” in “striped pajamas.” See Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). See Shmuel at the farm. See Shmuel run because men are yelling. See Bruno run to his new house. Come home, Bruno, said Mother (Vera Farmiga), in a British accent. Come, Bruno, come. See Bruno and Shmuel meet across an unguarded barbed wire fence. See Bruno and Shmuel laugh, perhaps because there are no soldiers guarding this fence, even though, in John Boyne’s allegorical children’s novel on which this film is based, the farm is Auschwitz. See Bruno, whose blue eyes and dark hair tend to make him look like a Nazi moppet, eat the food he said he would give to Shmuel. See Shmuel look even sadder than usual. See Bruno learn that the farmers are Jews.  See Bruno ponder the kind of false paradoxes that only an authorial contrivance, like the artificial naïf, would face: Jews are supposed to be bad, and yet Shmuel is nice. See Bruno tunnel, with astonishing rapidity, into the camp. See the film’s director, Mark Herman, take his camera into a gas chamber where naked men and children huddle, and two little hands clasp before the film cuts to black. Do not see the blood and excrement on the walls or the dead piled on the floor. See Mother howling outside the camp in the rain as the camera hovers over her. See Father (David Thewlis), realizing that his son has been swept away by the Nazi death machine he himself helps run, look horror-stricken. See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don’t.  “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some mild violence.</text>
