      <text> With candor, sympathy and excellent cinematography, "La Petite Jerusalem" reflects on the bodies of two sisters in Sarcelles, a drab Parisian suburb called home by an enclave of Orthodox Jewish immigrants. Laura (Fanny Valette) leans toward the secular; she is skeptical, a student of philosophy and falling in love with a mustachioed Algerian named Djamel (Hedi Tillette de Clermont-Tonnerre). Mathilde (Elsa Zylberstein), her sister, is devout, but conflicted by dual fidelities to God and husband (Bruno Todeschini). The latter, sexually frustrated, is no longer faithful. Can faith be reconciled with foreplay?  The writer-director, Karin Albou, opens up the intimate physical and psychological spaces of these two strong women through a style indebted to the sophisticated impressionism of Claire Denis and Lucrecia Martel. Her camera prowls, nimble and alert, attentive to the heft and texture of things. Close attention is paid to sound design, physiognomy and the suggestive capacities of unpredictable edits.  For the first full hour, as we're guided inside privacies of culture and consciousness, Ms. Albou sustains her rich and gently intoxicating mode of storytelling, a feat all the more admirable in light of the overly schematic script. Yet it eventually becomes clear that she doesn't quite know who Djamel is, nor how to develop his relationship with Laura along profitable dramatic or thematic lines. The focus slackens as the narrative expands; restrained as it is, "La Petite Jerusalem" isn't quite small enough.</text>
