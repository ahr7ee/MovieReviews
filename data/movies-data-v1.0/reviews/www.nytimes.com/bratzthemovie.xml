      <text> Arriving as inevitably as puberty, “Bratz” introduces the swollen-headed, fashion-addicted dolls of the title  to a live-action movie and an even more prominent position in the tweener universe. In human form, however, their craniums appear normal, giving no indication of the acres of retail space within.  In a high school story that feels hastily composed from fragments of much better movies, the four ethnically diverse leads use their special talents — soccer, science, cheerleading, singing — to discover themselves and destroy clique culture. This be-yourself message would be more convincing if it weren’t so mixed; applauding athleticism while coaxing female jocks into stiletto heels is hardly the height of girl power. To the Bratz, individualism is only cool as long as it doesn’t require unfashionable pants.  With their tender hearts and lip-gloss dreams, these teenage princesses are direct descendants of Alicia Silverstone’s Cher in “Clueless,” although Sean McNamara’s TV-ready framing and coarse direction lack Amy Heckerling’s snap and style. Instead, the movie’s veneer of inclusion — the hottest guy in school is also deaf — fails to hide some egregious racial stereotyping (the Latina Brat inexplicably shares her home with a mariachi band) and a script that wants to have it both ways. It takes a certain amount of genius to stage a derisive spoof of MTV’s “My Super Sweet 16” while enthusiastically aping the very materialism it promotes.  “Bratz” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a single mother on hard times, two boys on the make and four girls on the offensive.</text>
