      <text>he reasons to avoid "House of D," David Duchovny's earnest, unwatchable coming-of-age drama, can best be summarized in a simple declarative sentence. Robin Williams plays a retarded janitor. For some reason, Mr. Williams, a comedian of prodigious gifts who occasionally shows himself to be a more than capable character actor, is fatefully drawn to a particular kind of sentimentality. The character of Pappass, a wise, kindly, mentally disabled man who helps guide a troubled boy on life's difficult journey, must have been irresistible to him, given his track record of crinkly, heartfelt mugging. "House of D," for its part, will be irresistible to those hardy, wet-eyed souls who cherish "Patch Adams," "Bicentennial Man" and "Jakob the Liar." Enough said. Mr. Duchovny, directing his first feature film (which he also wrote), revisits New York in the scruffy, neighborly 1970's, when Greenwich Village, where most of the story takes place, was apparently more like an actual village than it is today. On his son's 13th birthday, the narrator, Tom Warshaw (Mr. Duchovny), an American artist living in Paris, tells the story of his own adolescence, a tale of mischief and first love that culminates in heartbreak and that is meant to explain the man he has become. That man, married to a lovely French woman (Magali Amadei), is moody, soulful and perpetually late, but the stunning narcissism of his birthday gift to his son is met with mawkish, wide-eyed gratitude. In the flashback that occupies most of the film, Tom (who is played as a teenager by Anton Yelchin) lives in a brownstone apartment with his mother (Tï¿½a Leoni), whose drastic mood swings are explained by the sudden death of her husband a few months before. Pappass, simple-hearted and amiable, serves both as Tom's little brother and his surrogate father. The boy also receives valuable life lessons from an incarcerated woman (Erykah Badu) who shouts down-home wisdom through the bars of her cell in the women's House of Detention on West 10th Street, a vanished  edifice that gives the movie its title. Pappass and Tom earn some extra money delivering meat for a local butcher, and their days are a carefree ramble through a city full of lovable eccentrics, a few of them played by semi-well-known actors. Tom, who attends a starchy all-male private school (presided over by Frank Langella in a clerical collar), develops a crush on a cute Upper West Sider named Melissa (Zelda Williams), and their romance unleashes a wildly improbable avalanche of trouble. As is true of many actors who turn to directing, Mr. Duchovny is generous with his cast, and some of the scenes, in particular those involving Mr. Yelchin and Ms. Williams, have an easy, lived-in rhythm. (The scenes with Mr. Williams are another matter entirely.) Mostly, though, the burden of the story, which is maudlin and entirely unbelievable, weighs down even the more credible performances. "House of D" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references, occasional profanity and some drug use.</text>
