      <text> Correction Appended  “Bob Funk” looks like a comedy, acts like a comedy and sounds like a comedy, but it isn’t funny. This is a problem in a movie that aims for laughs. It’s also part of the point.  “Bob Funk” has sadder things on its mind.  Written and directed by Craig Carlisle, the film stars Michael Leydon Campbell as the loudmouth, alcoholic Bob, the most disaffected employee of the family business, a high-end bedding emporium called Funk Foam and Futon. Bob straggles in with hangovers only to hit on customers or pass out. He is in, well, a funk. Mom (Grace Zabriskie) demotes him to janitor.  Everything in “Bob Funk” — characters, sets, situations  —  has a perky, glossy feel to it, the slightly heightened reality of an upscale sitcom. Mr. Carlisle adapted the material from his own play, yet it doesn’t have the stilted, suffocating atmosphere of most stage-to-screen works. It also doesn’t have a coherent point of view;  it’s pitched uneasily between affable slacker yuks that fall flat and a more sentimental agenda about Bob becoming  sober and learning life lessons.  Enter Miss Thorne (Rachel Leigh Cook), a slightly goofy but eminently lovable addition to the Funk family business and the object of Bob’s affections. Given the ham-handed nomenclature, she might just as easily  have been called Little Miss Sunshine.  “Bob Funk” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for heavy drinking, vulgar womanizing and language.</text>
