      <text> Tru (Najarra Townsend) has two mommies — one black (Cynda Williams), one white (Alexandra Paul), both lesbians — and they’re all living happily ever after. Or were, at least, until they left San Francisco.  Transplanted to a conservative suburb in Southern California, Tru is suddenly confronted with a local phenomenon as unfamiliar as year-round sunshine: homophobia in her high school. She starts a relationship with Lodell (Matthew Thompson), the handsome high school quarterback who turns out to be, whaddya know, a gay man on the down low. To shield Lodell from his bigoted peers, or at least his own ego issues, Tru grudgingly agrees to be his beard.  Drama ensues as Tru, living up to her righteous name, establishes a gay-straight alliance at school where assorted bi-curious types mingle, along with an actual gay named Walter (Tye Olson) and the superhot, suspiciously stylish but only apparently gay Trevor (Jake Abel).  Will Lodell come out and get down with Walter? Will Tru and Trevor make sweet, progressive love? And, more important, does the world need yet another peppy  gay self-esteem indie like “Tru Loved”? Probably not, though the writer and director Stewart Wade pulls this one off with heart.</text>
