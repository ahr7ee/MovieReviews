      <text> “Bandslam” may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable, namely Vanessa Hudgens of the “High School Musical” films and Aly Michalka of the Disney Channel series “Phil of the Future.” Of course neither star is R-rated-ready (Ms. Hudgens’s well-publicized misadventures with cellphone photos notwithstanding), but “Bandslam” nudges them away from factory fodder.  A newcomer, Gaelan Connell (with Michael Cera’s nerdiness but less wan sensitivity), is Will, an alienated student who moves to Lodi, N.J., with his mom (Lisa Kudrow, perfectly straddling drama and humor, while evincing charming if familiar Kudrowisms). Will becomes the manager for the motley band of the ex-cheerleader Charlotte (Ms. Michalka).  Charlotte’s group is challenging her previous one, led by her smug ex, Ben (Scott Porter), the favored contender at the annual interschool battle of the bands. Will also meets the broody, bookish Sa5m (the 5, you see, is silent), played unconvincingly by Ms. Hudgens.  Ms. Michalka exudes a robust assurance befitting her musical experience. (As half of the sister duo Aly and A J, she has recorded two appealing albums.)  Ms. Hudgens has a reggae-tinged number refreshingly distant from the arid club lite of her own record. Tidy, heartfelt direction by Todd Graff (“Camp”); astute song references; and a David Bowie cameo transcend the formula underpinnings and keep “Bandslam” buoyant, gratifying and, yes, rocking.  “Bandslam” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It includes cellphones, text messages, loud instruments, parental anxiety and a tasteful lesson in how to kiss.</text>
