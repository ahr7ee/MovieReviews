      <text>hey rise up like the dead at the day of reckoning, voice after voice, story after story, the troubled history of a shameful past," muses Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an anguished South African poet and journalist attending public hearings conducted in the late 1990's by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Anna, whose on-the-scene dispatches are carried on South African state radio and on National Public Radio in the United States, is the weepy, hand-wringing conscience of John Boorman's high-minded but hopelessly wooden film "In My Country." At the commission's hearings, conducted from 1996 to 1998, the commission investigating human rights abuses during apartheid took testimony from more than 20,000 witnesses; 2,000 testified publicly. As the predominantly black victims confronted their tormenters face to face in the courtroom, many broke down, recalling atrocities, kidnappings and the disappearance of loved ones. The perpetrators, in turn, were promised amnesty if they faced up to their deeds, told the whole ugly truth, expressed contrition and could prove that their crimes were politically motivated. That old standby, "I was only following orders," was the usual excuse. The hearings upheld the South African principle of "ubuntu," which pursues reconciliation instead of revenge by absolving all sides of their transgressions. Anna has strict instructions from her boss to keep her reports under 40 seconds. At one point her supervisor calls to praise her for having captured an especially bloodcurdling courtroom scream. In this grindingly earnest film, that congratulation sounds a rare and welcome note of media cynicism. The movie reconstructs choice tidbits of the testimony given by a tiny sampling of victims, all but one of them black. Their graphic descriptions of rape and emasculation, of tongues being severed and of burying what body parts they can retrieve of loved ones are at once too much and not enough. Sandwiched between numbing paragraphs of point-counterpoint argument, these shattering fragments are rushed and feel as jarring as screams erupting during a prayer meeting. The screenplay, by Ann Peacock, who adapted the story from Antjie Krog's memoir "Country of My Skull," makes the fatal mistake of turning characters into mouthpieces. Even when they modify their positions, the people remain too schematic for you to sense an emotional groundswell that isn't meticulously preprogrammed. Anna meets her rhetorical match in Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson), a surly reporter for The Washington Post who brings his own angry racial agenda to the hearings. To him, forgiveness is unimaginable and the forum seems just another diabolical trick to take white supremacists off the hook. As Anna's naï¿½ve idealism collides with Langston's bitterness, the movie has a chance to come to life. But in a turn of events that occurs without psychological preparation, Anna, who is married with three children, and Langston, a married family man, begin an affair. The chemistry between Mr. Jackson and Ms. Binoche (whose Afrikaans accent is shaky at best) is nonexistent. In their love scenes, Mr. Jackson, who appears stiff and uncomfortable throughout the film, seems lost in thought. But the affair provides an excuse for Anna to utter one of the most stilted goodbyes in movie history when it's time to part: "My skin will never forget you." Her affair and its aftermath shoehorn a distracting extra layer of meaning into the movie by dragging issues of betrayal and forgiveness from the courtroom into the bedroom. Every few minutes the film awkwardly splices in another segment of Langston's continuing interview with Colonel De Jager, a fictional torture-loving white South African police chief, played by Brendan Gleeson with a nasty gleam in his eye. When he taunts Langston with his descriptions of the orgiastic fun at a secret torture farm, he chortles fiendishly about how practicing torture, mutilation and castration is "better than sex." As "In My Country" winds down, it makes sure that everyone shoulders a measure of guilt. Anna discovers a skeleton in her own family closet, while her free-spirited black South African assistant, Dumi Mkhalipi (Menzi Ngubane), also turns out to have blood on his hands. So much for the good guys and the bad, the film sermonizes; we are all culpable. Guilt rules. "In My Country" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, and its graphic testimony pulls no punches.</text>
