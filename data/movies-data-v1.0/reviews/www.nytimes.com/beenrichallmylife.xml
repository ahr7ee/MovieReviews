      <text> “Been Rich All My Life,” an admiring portrait of the Silver Belles, a troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical document and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. Bertye  Lou Wood, Cleo Hayes, Marion Coles, Fay Ray and Elaine Ellis, the indefatigably spirited dancers who still perform in matching glitter-encrusted costumes, met in the 1930’s as chorus dancers and reunited in 1985.  The documentary is generously supplied with historical film clips of the women’s glory days, when they danced at the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club, Small’s Paradise and Connie’s Inn and worked with bandleaders like Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Jimmy Lunceford. In one clip Ms. Wood, the group’s feisty senior member, is shown dancing beside Bill Robinson.  She also proudly recalls leading a strike by the Apollo chorus line that established the American Guild of Variety Artists as a performers’ union with clout. Ms. Hayes remembers the racial discrimination that she and Ms. Wood faced while performing in the first black USO unit during World War II. Ms. Ray boasts about her post-chorus-line days working as a welder building naval ships during the war.  In one of several mishaps that befall the group during the making of the documentary, Ms. Hayes falls down a flight of subway stairs, endures months of painful rehabilitation and returns to the stage. Ms. Coles (the widow of the legendary dancer Honi Coles) has to have a pacemaker installed. Ms. Ellis perseveres through radiation therapy for cancer.  Nothing stops them except the inevitable. When Ms. Wood breaks her hip in a fall, it begins a precipitous decline that ends with her death.</text>
