      <text> Wrestling the good book from the hands of Mammon and dragging wealthy believers back to first principles can be an uphill job. So in "The Second Chance," two young pastors from opposite ends of the economic spectrum join forces to combat urban rot the old-fashioned way: with hands-on assistance and plenty of singing.  Ethan (the Christian musician Michael W. Smith) is the charismatic associate pastor of an affluent white suburban church where donations substitute for service. Resplendent in a frosted hairdo and Gucci suit, Ethan spends more time worrying about his television appearances than about the souls of his congregation. Forcibly assigned to an inner-city black church run by Pastor Jake (Jeff Obafemi Carr), Ethan tries to convince his board that another candidate would be more suitable ("I hear he speaks Ebonics"), but moral realignment awaits. After a few days in the hood helping addicts and dodging gangs, Ethan is left wondering whether choosing expensive china patterns for his upcoming nuptials is the best way to do the Lord's work.  Startlingly direct if unavoidably preachy, "The Second Chance" takes aim at Christianity's racial divide and the corporatization of faith. Its message is simple: being a Christian requires more than just dropping a check in the collection plate every Sunday morning.  "The Second Chance" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some drug references and mild violence.</text>
