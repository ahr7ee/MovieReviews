      <text> Devised by committee, plotted by machine and acted on cruise control, “Forever Strong” stages an all-too-familiar teenage morality play on the churned earth of a high school rugby field in Salt Lake City.  For Rick Penning (Sean Faris), that field is his arena to vent against a spineless mother (Julie Warner) and an angry coach and father (Neal McDonough). A belligerent player and all-round pill, Rick is in dire need of an attitude intervention.  So when the time-honored convergence of beer, convertible and hot chick lands him in juvie,  he is on the road to learning more than just how to clean a toilet and smuggle Vicodin.  An After School Special that somehow sneaked into the multiplex, “Forever Strong” operates at the subbasement level of sports as therapy, smashing bodies and jerking tears at rigidly timed intervals. As Rick, under the moral tutelage of Coach  Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole) and his former rivals, learns to replace drinking, drugs and women with prayer circles, community service and Maori chants, the virility of the scrum becomes a spiritual rite of passage.  Based on the coaching philosophies of the real Mr. Gelwix — who deserves a better tribute than this one —  “Forever Strong” is a mawkish drama hobbled by a thoroughly unpleasant and uncharismatic lead performance. The wonder is  that anyone would think Rick is worth saving in the first place.  “Forever Strong” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Characters pop pills, cans and  one another.</text>
