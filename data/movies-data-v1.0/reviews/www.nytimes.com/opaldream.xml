      <text> A warning to parents everywhere about the dangers of indulging irrational  behavior, “Opal Dream” is a sickly sweet tale of deep dysfunction masquerading as family solidarity.  In the Australian outback, in the opal mining community of Coober Pedy, Rex Williamson (Vince Colosimo) hunts maniacally for the perfect stone while his family endures a life of dust and deprivation. Proving that obsession flows downhill, Rex’s 9-year old daughter, Kellyanne (Sapphire Boyce), talks incessantly to a pair of invisible friends, insisting that they be fed and acknowledged as part of the family.  Instead of packing her off to therapy, Rex concocts an elaborate plan to “lose” the annoying pals. But  it backfires, and  he is left with a terminally grieving daughter and a charge of poaching another miner’s claim. Therapy would have been so much easier.  Adopting a tone of whimsy and treacle, the director, Peter Cattaneo — whose blue-collar strippers in “The Full Monty” had fancies of their own — fills the screen with lollipops and cute children’s drawings, while Robert Humphreys’s cinematography bleaches the already lunar landscape to a uniform pallor.  But as the film’s sentiment congeals in a mock funeral, with the entire town enabling Kellyanne’s disorder, the ghost of a real movie flits across the screen —  one capable of acknowledging that Kellyanne’s invisible friends are no different from the invisible opals dancing in her dad’s head.  “Opal Dream” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mild violence and language, and a dangerous amount of sugar.</text>
