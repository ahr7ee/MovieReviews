      <text> “The Protector” concerns a transsexual dragon lady (Jin Xing) who absconds to Australia with a sacred baby elephant from Thailand, and the efforts of Kham (Tony Jaa), a provincial guardian, to bust skulls and get it back. This is achieved through flabbergasting deployments of Muay Thai, a martial arts discipline in which force is concentrated in the torso and released through the knees, elbows and shoulders. The effect is scrappier than the traditional kung-fu movie moves, with their balletic flurry of the extremities, but the proletarian righteousness is pure classicism. Ditto the “whu-pssht!” thwack for each body blow.  Directed by Prachya Pinkaew from a screenplay reducible to a single exclamation (“You stole my elephant!”), “The Protector” supersizes the formula of “Ong Bak,” his previous film starring Mr. Jaa’s muscles. The grimy street vibe of that picture, in which our hero went muy Muay Thai on the folks who desecrated his village temple, has been cleaned up by the producers, who have budgeted for elephants, explosions, speedboats, helicopters, high-end Jacuzzis, C.G.I. interludes and extreme sports montages.  The American distributor has added its own polish by partially dubbing the dialogue into English and slapping one of the most meaningless phrases in the language — “Presented by Quentin Tarantino” — above the credits. This tinkering inadvertently fortifies the theme of third-world exploitation but does little to distract from the pleasure of watching Mr. Jaa hurl himself willy nilly at an onslaught of randomly generated foes (the swordsman, the Capoeira dude, the bodybuilder, the in-line skater wielding a fluorescent light bulb).  “The Protector” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for pervasive video-game violence.</text>
