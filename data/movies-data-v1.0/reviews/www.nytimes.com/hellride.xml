      <text> “Hell Ride,” a silly slice of genre gone bad, takes place in an American desert populated by middle-aged bikers and the nubile, often topless young women who love them. The guys, who have names like Pistolero and the Gent (he wears a tuxedo, see), ride around brawling and posturing and pretending they’re in better movies.  A jumble of influences, “Hell Ride” borrows its jump-around-in-time structure and absurdist wordplay from Quentin Tarantino (who apparently doesn’t hold a grudge; he’s credited as executive producer) and its sense of empty spaces and hovering doom from Sergio Leone. All that’s missing is those directors’ talent.  The quadruple threat responsible for “Hell Ride,” Larry Bishop — writer, director, producer and actor (he plays Pistolero) — kicked around B-movies in the 1960s and ’70s, making his mark as an actor in biker pictures, which he obviously loves. But he burdens his film with clumsy art-house ambitions that clash with its embrace of bikes, beer and booty. If any of this sounds amusing, be warned: it’s not. It’s depressingly self-conscious and turgid, and a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour can’t drag “Hell Ride” out of the mire.  “Hell Ride” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity, profanity and only-in-Pistolero’s-dreams sexual situations.</text>
