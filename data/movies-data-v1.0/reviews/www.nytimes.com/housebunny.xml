      <text> All hail Anna Faris, fake bimbo par excellence, master of the birdbrained double take, our reigning queen of intelligent stupidity. On the sneaker-clad heels of “Smiley Face,” an inspired stoner farce from 2007, come the plastic stiletto shenanigans of “The House Bunny,” a breezy, ditzy comedy about the misadventures of a Playboy bunny exiled from the chinchilla cocoon of Hugh Hefner’s mansion.  What’s a bunny to do? For Shelley Darlingson (Ms. Faris), it’s a pep-stepping, breast-jiggling hippity-hop to the next best thing to chez Playboy: the sisterhood of the sorority.  Rejected from the requisite house full of class-obsessed brats, Shelley falls in with the obligatory clutch of “ugly girls,” a ragtag tribe of crypto-lesbians, semi-midgets, clueless nerds and sarcastic anarchists. OMG, no wonder Zeta Alpha Zeta is about to be closed down for lack of pledges and heinous crimes against footwear. Makeover time! And ladies, don’t forget, “The eyes are the nipples of the face.”  Directed by Fred Wolf from a screenplay by the writers of “Legally Blonde,” Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, “House Bunny” puts a cheerful spin on its many clichés. This particular wheel hasn’t been reinvented, but at least it gets a nice fresh coat of bubblegum-pink paint and a star to pilot it with aplomb.</text>
