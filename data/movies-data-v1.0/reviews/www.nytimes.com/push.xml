      <text> At a time when most of our high schoolers struggle to make change without electronic help, the proliferation of movie and television characters with special abilities is more than a little utopian. In “Push,” these abilities are rooted in Nazi experiments to transform people into biological weapons, and the movie is crawling with clairvoyants, mind controllers and human bloodhounds. As far as I can tell, the only ability in short supply is acting.  Cued by the title, the plot can be described thus: Run. Hide. Fight. Repeat. Navigating a Hong Kong bristling with partially constructed skyscrapers, a small band of good guys led by a telekinetic (Chris Evans) and a clairvoyant (Dakota Fanning) hunt for a mysterious suitcase.  On their trail is a nebulous government agency known as the Division (in the form of a dapper Djimon Hounsou), as well as a Chinese gang fronted by two brothers whose screams can pop blood vessels. They’d have a hard time finding any in Kira (the insufferably bland Camilla Belle), a pallid waif whose allegiances are not clear.  Imaginatively filmed by Peter Sova, “Push” has a dizzying, chaotic energy that pulls you along. Paul McGuigan directs with maximum efficiency and minimum use of computers, creating effects that feel satisfyingly tangible. Trust me: when those Chinese brothers scream, more than your ears will be bleeding.  “Push” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Dakota Fanning gets sloshed, and everyone else gets bashed, bloodied or badly bruised.</text>
