      <text> Actually, it's not Shiloh the adorable beagle who needs saving during most of this third film based on Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's novels about him. It's his abusive former owner, Judd Travers (Scott Wilson). The little boy who now owns Shiloh, Marty Preston (Jason Dolley), poses the question in voice-over: "All I could think about was how mean Judd used to be. Could somebody like that really change?"  Like the earlier Shiloh films, this one is set in a lovely rural world where houses have screen doors and front porches, but there's nothing simplistic about life there. Marty learns from his parents, his friends, a veterinarian, a teacher and even a kindly bartender about fairness, prejudice, motivations for human cruelty and the likelihood of moral salvation.  This is also a realistic world, one in which every scare doesn't turn into a tragedy, children are bored by visiting their grandmother at the nursing home, and emotion can be embarrassing. (Judd reacts to Marty's offer of friendship by smiling shyly and saying, "Well, then.")  "Saving Shiloh" is touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful, but more action-packed than its predecessors, thanks to escaped convicts, a local murder and a truly suspenseful finale, with lives at stake. (But it's such wholesome suspense!) Most important, the dog that plays Shiloh gets plenty of cute close-ups and reaction shots.  "Saving Shiloh" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some mild violence, references to a corpse and a fairly frightening near-drowning.</text>
