      <text>n this dreary erotic roundelay, Caleb (Scott Lunsford) is a straight man who likes tough women. Gwen (Emily Stiles) is a straight girl with a taste for gay men. Along with chic apartments and campy vintage outfits, each possesses that ultimate urban accessory: a gay roommate. Insecure, smart-mouthed Kyle (Jim Verraros), who lives with Caleb, is pining away for Gwen's roomie, the hunky musician Marc (Ryan Carnes). When Caleb pretends to be gay to get close to Gwen, confusion reigns, until a virtuosic act of three-way phone sex sets everything, well, straight, and each of the four principals finds love with an object of the appropriate sex. Think of it as a modern-day variant on a Shakespearean comedy, only without the verbal felicity or dramatic structure. "Eating Out" is the feature film debut of the director Q. Allan Brocka, whose series of animated shorts, "Rick &amp; Steve, the Happiest Gay Couple in All the World," concerned the romantic travails of a pair of Lego figures. Mass-produced plastic toys might be more distinguishable from one another than the cast members of "Eating Out," a generic assortment of smooth-skinned gym bunnies who sit around dishing shrill double-entendres and strained banter. The one surprise in the cast is Mr. Verraros, a former contestant on "American Idol," in his first acting role, as the queeny, scheming Kyle. Despite the limitations of the role as written, he has a scrappy energy that sets him apart from the bland and vulgar proceedings. "We're just bodies with organic needs ... we shouldn't deny our bodies," Gwen tells Caleb in one of her many frantic attempts to seduce him over to "the other team" (for which, as it turns out, he was batting all along). In cinema as in life, this kind of biological reductionism sounds better in the abstract than it plays out in practice.</text>
