      <text> In “Morning Light,” a sweepingly beautiful documentary unmoored by democratic intentions, 15 amateur sailors prepare to cross more than 2,000 miles of Pacific Ocean in the race known as the Transpac.  The Kentucky Derby of open-sea racing, the biennial Transpac is a grueling, exhilarating haul from Los Angeles to Honolulu and a daunting prospect for novices. Ranging in age from 18 to 23 and with varying degrees of experience, the 15 hopefuls — who will eventually be winnowed to a crew of 11 for the sloop Morning Light — endure months of rigorous training, soggy sleeping quarters and lots of throwing up. They couldn’t be more thrilled.  Yet for all its sparkling seascapes and shiny, happy faces, “Morning Light” is sunny-side-up filmmaking that sacrifices dramatic focus for generic observations on teamwork and character building. The writer and director, Mark Monroe, could have shaped his adventurous material in any number of ways to engage nonsailors, including highlighting gender issues (an intriguingly chauvinistic conversation conducted in the absence of the crew’s sole female member is abruptly cut short) or exploring the feelings of the four rejectees.  Instead he allows his appealing young subjects to blend into a single, relentlessly upbeat personality. Like the disastrously overpopulated “Amazing Race: Family Edition,” “Morning Light” never finds a way to make us care who wins.  “Morning Light” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). One broken arm and several shattered dreams.</text>
