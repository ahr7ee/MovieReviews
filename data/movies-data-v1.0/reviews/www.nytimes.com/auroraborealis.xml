      <text> “Aurora Borealis” stars Joshua Jackson as Duncan, a boring, damaged, apathetic 20-something whose major claim on our attention is the type of bathetic cuddliness perfected by wet puppies and Mark Ruffalo. The fixation of independent movies on the arrested development of bourgeois dullards may have less to do with the relevance of the topic than the class of people who get to make movies. Whatever the case, James Burke directs from a screenplay by Brent Boyd.  Set in dead-of-winter Minneapolis, a ready-made metaphor for (groan, shiver) the chill in Duncan’s heart, the movie tells how life warms up when he goes to work at a nursing home. He takes the gig because hey, why not, and also so the filmmakers can place him in proximity to his crusty grandfather (Donald Sutherland). But the spark comes from connecting with Kate, a free-spirited nurse played with live-wire attention by Juliette Lewis.  Ms. Lewis excels as sexpots (“Natural Born Killers”) and psychopaths (“Natural Born Killers”) and, in her capacity as the lead singer of a rock band, she has mastered the art of crowd surfing in a bikini, but “Aurora Borealis” hints at an untapped talent for playing mature, textured women. Kate is spry, avid, generous and autonomous. You don’t doubt her galvanic effect on Duncan; you only wonder why she, and this film, care about him in the first place.  “Aurora Borealis” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language.</text>
