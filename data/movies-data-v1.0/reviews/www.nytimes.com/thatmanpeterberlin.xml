      <text> Andy Warhol asked to photograph the seat of his leather pants. Robert Mapplethorpe invited him to Fire Island. Tom of Finland drew his portrait. Sal Mineo took him to bed. He has been called the "Greta Garbo of porn" and "a full body genital." Denizens of Berlin, Paris, New York and San Francisco during the 1970's might remember spotting him on the street or lingering in doorways, a pulse-pounding vision in leather, floppy blond hair and ultrawhite skintight jeans. Who could forget?  One of the enduring icons of gay male eroticism, the phenomenon known as Peter Berlin is explored, explained, ogled and interviewed in the superb documentary "That Man: Peter Berlin." Self-made and endlessly self-obsessed, Mr. Berlin was the reluctant star of the gay pornographic classics "Nights in Black Leather" and "That Boy," but his true métier was the super-sexualized lifestyle as a perpetual work of performance art.  He was a photographer of some originality but only one subject, himself. Hundreds of outré self-portraits decorate the San Francisco apartment where Mr. Berlin still lives (still wearing those crazy outfits) and sat for a series of revealing and articulate interviews. The director, Jim Tushinski, couldn't have asked for a more colorful or brazenly documented subject, nor one who proves more unexpectedly endearing. Vivid reminiscences from John Waters, Armistead Maupin, the pornographic auteur Wakefield Poole and the artist Robert Richards elevate "That Man: Peter Berlin" into a minor classic of demimonde hagiography.</text>
