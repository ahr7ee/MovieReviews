      <text> Madeline Matheson (Jordan Ladd) is a vegan, baby-sling-wearing, animal-loving mom who wouldn’t hurt a fly. That is, until flies start gathering around her baby, Grace, who’s awfully pale and emits an odor even a mother can’t love.  “Grace” is also the title of this chilly and slow-moving horror film, which plays with ideas of mother love, obsessive child rearing and liberal spinelessness, adding a helping of trendy vampirism.  Ms. Ladd does admirably stoic work as a woman who insists on bringing her dead fetus to term and is rewarded with what appears to be a miracle but turns out to be a nightmare, especially when baby is hungry. While the writer and director, Paul Solet, keeps the on-screen violence to a minimum, he’s quite generous with the blood, much of it flowing from normally sacrosanct parts of the female anatomy.  Mr. Solet, who claims the “Hostel” meister Eli Roth as a mentor, is going for something psycho- and sociological in his first feature. While his story harks back to the tongue-in-cheek exploitation flick “It’s Alive,” the finished product plays like a mash-up of Roman Polanski’s two greatest creep-outs, “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Repulsion” (with a homage to Kathryn Bigelow’s vampire road movie, “Near Dark,” thrown in).  Mr. Solet does not possess anything close to Mr. Polanski’s storytelling or image-making skills, but with the help of his sound crew (four people are given sound design or editing credits), he keeps you on the edge of your seat, or perhaps the edge of fleeing the theater.</text>
