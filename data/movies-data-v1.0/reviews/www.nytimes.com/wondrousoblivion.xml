      <text>Form and content fight to the death in “Wondrous Oblivion,” Paul Morrison’s defiantly gauzy tale of racial friction in 1960s England. Bathed in a peachy glow that initially seems appropriate, the movie follows 11-year-old David Wiseman (Sam Smith), a cricket-obsessed Jewish boy who lives with his émigré parents in a working-class suburb of South London. When the Samuelses, a lively Jamaican family, move in next door, the local gossips are horrified, but David’s parents, Ruth and Victor (Emily Woof and Stanley Townsend), are guiltily relieved to have neighborhood prejudice diverted to a new target. The families grow closer, however, when Dennis Samuels (a terrific Delroy Lindo) helps David improve his cricket game and, impressively shirtless, fixes Ruth’s broken washing machine. Suddenly, what began as an innocent coming-of-age tale swerves into adult territory as Dennis introduces Ruth to ska music and dirty dancing. While the oblivious Victor toils in the family store and the movie builds to a major tragedy, Ruth succumbs to a powerful crush. “You awakened something in me,” she breathes at Dennis over the garden fence, golden light dancing in her hair. Douglas Sirk would have been proud. Seven years ago, with the uncompromisingly bleak “Solomon and Gaenor,” Mr. Morrison handled bigotry with the darkness it deserves. In “Wondrous Oblivion,” he serves up prejudice over easy, joining the ranks of too many filmmakers who suggest that sports and sexual flirtation can cure all social ills. We wish.</text>
