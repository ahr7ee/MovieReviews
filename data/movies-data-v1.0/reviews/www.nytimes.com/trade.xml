      <text> An eagerly prurient dip into the sex-trafficking trough, “Trade” teeters between earnest exposé and salacious melodrama. Minus the film’s near-visible weight of conscience, success in the second category would have been virtually guaranteed.  Based on a controversial 2004 New York Times Magazine article by Peter Landesman, “Trade” is essentially an odd-couple road movie in which the extras are perverts and the victim is virginity. When 13-year-old Adriana (Paulina Gaitan) is kidnapped in Mexico City, her older brother, Jorge (a ferocious Cesar Ramos), assisted by an uptight Texas cop (Kevin Kline), tracks her abductors to New Jersey and an Internet sex auction.  Presenting Mexico as a country where everyone is corrupt and all visitors are fair game, Jose Rivera’s highly improbable and sensationalized screenplay leaves its actors no room for authenticity. Marco Kreuzpaintner directs with commendable energy, but squanders Daniel Gottschalk’s gold-dust-strewn images on hyperventilating voyeurism and an ending that sticks to your shoes, if not your heart. His intentions may be laudable but his goals are conflicted: in seeking to educate as well as tease, he ends up doing neither.  “Trade” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are raped, beaten, drugged and driven to suicide.</text>
