      <text> It's the end of the Ice Age (one of them, anyway), and global warming is front and center. Not that the tots will notice: they'll be much too busy wondering if Manny (voiced drearily by Ray Romano), the woolly mammoth who lost his family in the first movie, will hook up with a cute mammoth who's convinced that she's a possum.  But in "Ice Age: The Meltdown," dissolving glaciers do more than encourage mammoths to mate. They also inspire some decidedly biblical imagery from the director, Carlos Saldanha, who herds the animals to salvation in a giant, arklike boat. Viewing it from afar, you'll swear that the structure is illuminated by a beam of light from above.  But this sequel's most visible issue is creative exhaustion. The animation is uninspired (with so much ice, the creatures need to be twice as good-looking), and the story is humdrum. (The saber-toothed tiger learns to swim!) Scrat, the squirrel-rat hybrid featured prominently in the trailers, is given an extended shtick with his still-elusive acorn â€” an irritating device that serves only to chop the film into tidy, bite-size sections. Science also takes a hit this time, as two massive, coelacanthlike fish are unfrozen and turn out to be twice as lively as the rest of the cast. Next time, they should have their own movie.  "Ice Age: The Meltdown" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild language and innuendo.</text>
