      <text> The revisionist superhero trend takes a quizzical turn in “Big Man Japan,” a deadpan mockumentary with a lively sense of the perverse. Hitoshi Matsumoto, a popular and eccentric Japanese comedian who is the co-writer of the film, also directed and stars in it, playing Daisato,  the latest — and least — in a line of metamorphic heroes who grapple with Japan’s persistent monster problem.  Daisato transforms, via the application of electricity to his nipples (and some third-rate computer graphics), into a lumbering giant with an “Eraserhead” hairdo. But his everyday life couldn’t be smaller. Recently separated from his wife, Daisato mopes in the company of a scene-stealing stray cat, despondent over his nation’s increasing annoyance with the destruction and wanton wasting of resources that he leaves in his wake.  Worse yet, his ratings are down. Part character study, part media  satire and, by its finale, altogether bizarre, “Big Man Japan” plays a bit like a quieter, weirder version of “Hancock.”  The story alternates between Daisato’s daily doldrums — hanging out at his regular noodle joint or karaoke bar, slumping on a park bench — and his battles with threats like an eyeball-throwing monster and a creature emitting dangerously foul odors.  But the most impressive special effect here is Mr. Matsumoto’s hilariously restrained performance, a tour de force of comedic concision in a movie bloated by increasingly surreal developments.  “Big Man Japan” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for monster sexuality and cartoon violence.</text>
