      <text>ne question, perhaps the question, is this: what does art have to do with a guy eating a live octopus, and then hammering a couple of (human) heads? The guy in question, the one doing the gobbling and hammering, is Oh Dae-su, the central character in the frenzied Korean thriller "Oldboy." The latest in pulp-fiction cool, "Oldboy" was directed by Park Chanwook, whose films, including the very fine "Joint Security Area" and the repugnant "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance," have won him admirers in rarefied circles, including the Cannes Film Festival, where last year "Oldboy" took second prize. Given the body count and sadistic violence in "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" and "Oldboy," it's no surprise that Mr. Park's largest fan base may be those cult-film aficionados for whom distinctions between high art and low are unknown, unrecognized and certainly unwelcome. After going on a raucous drunk, an ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik, who also starred in Im Kwon-taek's "Chihwaseon"), is mysteriously abducted to a private prison. There, with a television set and a painting of a leering Jesus-like figure for company, Dae-su keeps body and mind together (if barely), mostly by working out and chipping away at his prison walls. Eventually, he's released, whereupon he meets a kindly, predictably beautiful sushi waitress, Mido (Gang Hye-jung), gobbles down that poor octopus and proves that he wields a mean hammer. In time, he comes face to face with his anonymous tormenter, a smoothie with a smile named Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), who gives him five days - or else! - to learn why he was imprisoned. A master of composition, Mr. Park makes some of the snazziest-looking pulp fiction going. He has an impeccable if unoriginal visual style, indebted both to the usual masters (Hitchcock, Kubrick, with a nod at Buï¿½uel) and especially to David Fincher, whose pop nihilism and dedication to the plasticity of the medium hang heavily over this film. That generally makes "Oldboy" entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem. The screenplay, which the director helped write, is the least of the film's attractions; certainly the puerile, big-bang finish, which flashes the story back to high school and a teenage "slut," suggests that Mr. Park knows the adolescent mindset of his target audience all too well. "Oldboy" is a good if trivial genre movie, no more, no less. There's no denying that Mr. Park is some kind of virtuoso, but so what? So was the last guy who directed a Gap commercial. Cinematic virtuosity for its own sake, particularly as expressed through cinematography - in loop-the-loop camera work and, increasingly, in computer-assisted ornamentation - is a modern plague that threatens to bury us in shiny, meaningless movies. Historically speaking, the most interesting thing about "Oldboy" is that like so much "product" now coming out of Hollywood, it is a B movie tricked out as an A movie. Once, a film like this, predicated on extreme violence and staying within the prison house of genre rather than transcending it, would have been shot on cardboard sets with two-bit talent. It would have had its premiere in Times Square. The fact that "Oldboy" is embraced by some cinephiles is symptomatic of a bankrupt, reductive postmodernism: one that promotes a spurious aesthetic relativism (it's all good) and finds its crudest expression in the hermetically sealed world of fan boys. (At this point, it's perhaps worth pointing out that the head of the jury at Cannes last year was none other than Quentin Tarantino.) In this world, aesthetic and moral judgments - much less philosophical and political inquiries - are rejected in favor of a vague taxonomy of cool that principally involves ever more florid spectacles of violence. As in, "Wow, he's hammering those dudes with a knife stuck in his back - cool!" Or, "He's about to drop that guy and his dog from the roof - way cool!" Kiss-kiss, bang-bang, yawn-yawn. We are a long way from Pasolini and Peckinpah. "Oldboy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes wall-to-wall extreme sadistic violence, a little sex and partial nudity.</text>
