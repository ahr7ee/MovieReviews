      <text> The maudlin, grotesque western “September Dawn,” about the  massacre on  Sept. 11, 1857,    of  about 120 settlers by Mormons  (and their  Paiute Indian mercenaries),  apes “Schindler’s List” in hopes of creating a Christian Holocaust picture.  Directed by Christopher Cain (“Young Guns”)  and written   by Mr. Cain and  Carole Whang Schutter (after  Ms. Schutter’s novel), “Dawn”  commemorates the mass murder     of horse-traders and their families  traveling through Utah Territory on their way to California from Arkansas. The Mormons already wish ill upon the sugar-sweet  settlers, but their ire blossoms when a teenage Mormon named Jonathan Samuelson (Trent Ford),  son of the glowering Mormon bishop Jacob Samuelson (Jon Voight), falls for one of the wagon-train party, a kindly gal (Tamara Hope).  In flashbacks and framing devices that feature a bewigged Terence Stamp as Brigham Young and Dean Cain as Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, “Dawn” alludes to the persecution that the insular, polygamist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints endured in the early 19th century.  But these aspects are eclipsed  in the film by the Mormons’ Snidely Whiplash-like  treachery. Their evil is established in an early sequence that cross-cuts between two dinner-table prayers: the  travelers wishing the Mormons well, and Jacob urging God to please send Satan’s children to hell, amen — in a grimly righteous tone that begs for the punch line, “Now please pass the ham.”    “September Dawn” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence.</text>
