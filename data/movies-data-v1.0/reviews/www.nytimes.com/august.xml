      <text> Embracing superficiality in both subject and style, “August” is a low-key drama in high-tech clothing. Set in New York City in August 2001, in the tense climate of a dot-com startup where stock price and corporate morale are plummeting, the movie unspools with an unrelieved cynicism and a metallic aftertaste.  Dancing on cold surfaces requires very sure footing, and Josh Hartnett struggles to maintain his. As Tom, the silver-tongued company co-founder, he inhabits a Hedi Slimane silhouette and an elegantly impersonal loft. A walking sales pitch, Tom repels his kinder, gentler brother and partner (Adam Scott) and prefers expensive toys to women. As with Willy Loman, it’s never clear what he’s selling: his product is as inchoate as his personality.  The dot-com boom and bust is a terrific subject, and “August” has a dark desperation that’s morbidly compelling. But the movie’s amoral momentum is fatally slowed by an acronym-heavy script and flimsy characterizations that offer fine actors — including Rip Torn as Tom’s contemptuous father and Naomie Harris as his missed opportunity — little to play.  All of which makes the 11th-hour appearance of David Bowie, as a ruthless venture capitalist, even more welcome. His final confrontation with Tom is a brutal reminder that old-money influence trumps new-millennium bravado any month of the year.  “August” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, weak sex and robust greed.</text>
