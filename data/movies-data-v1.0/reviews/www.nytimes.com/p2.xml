      <text> Swift and stealthy “P2” is a canny exploitation of one of the urban woman’s  greatest fears: the after-hours parking garage. Throw in a car that won’t start, a creepy security guard and a filmmaking team with perfect synchronicity, and the result is a minimalist nightmare.  It’s Christmas Eve, and Angela Bridges (Rachel Nichols), a workaholic lawyer with a cool demeanor and a hot body, is dismayed to find herself trapped in her deserted office building. Her mood doesn’t improve when she’s attacked and sedated and wakes up tied to a chair wearing a cleavage-baring frock and blood-red lipstick. Seated opposite is Thomas (Wes Bentley), the smiling security guard who only wants to share his Christmas dinner and love of Hemingway — a predilection guaranteed to make any thinking woman run for the hills.  The debut feature of Franck Khalfoun (who wrote the screenplay with Alexandre Aja and Grégory Levasseur), “P2” is bloody but not punishingly so, limiting the gore to tightly edited set pieces that never linger. Having previously collaborated on “High Tension,”  the filmmakers work with smooth compatibility to extract maximum threat from their cavernous location. Prowling from one vacant level to the next, the camera sweeps over damp concrete and misshapen shadows while Elvis and Eartha Kitt warble seasonally on the soundtrack. Taking the bus to work suddenly seems like a very good idea.  “P2” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are beaten, bitten, blinded and squished.</text>
