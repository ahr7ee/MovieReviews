      <text>Early in the documentary “Planet B-Boy,” an experienced street dancer asserts that break dancing is “as legitimate as any dance that has ever existed.” This brisk nonfiction feature directed by Benson Lee makes his case, showing international teams of break dancers — or b-boys — battling to win best-in-the-nation status in their home countries, then going on to compete in the 2005  world finals at the Volkswagenhalle in Braunschweig, Germany. After a prologue sketching break dancing’s rise and fall in 1980s America and its subsequent international embrace, Mr. Lee tracks teams from several countries as they devise and perfect their routines. Certain nationalities  are known for particular strengths: the French for their muscular expressiveness, the Japanese for their innovative choreography, the Koreans for their technical excellence and conceptual boldness. (One of the two Korean teams competing in the world finals retells the history of North and South Korea in dance.) Nagging flaws keep this documentary from realizing its potential. Choppy editing prevents us from fully appreciating the dancers’ grace; a couple of parent-child reconciliation stories seem shoehorned in to add “heart.” Still, from moment to moment, “Planet B-Boy” is fun, sometimes thrilling and packed with illuminating details and striking personalities —  like  the Korean dancer, nicknamed Laser, who we’re told “has spent  three  or  five  years solely spinning on his head.</text>
