      <text> With its raw, grainy texture and forceful sense of urgency, Shane Meadows's unsparing revenge thriller "Dead Man's Shoes" is reminiscent of a kind of film prominent in the 1970's, most notably Sam Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs."  Like a cross between  that film's antihero, a nonthreatening everyman forced to take violent measures, and the unraveling war veteran Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver,"  the always fantastic Paddy Considine evokes both sensitivity and explosiveness as Richard, a troubled ex-soldier who returns to his hometown in northern England with payback on his mind.  The power of the performance by Mr. Considine, who wrote the script with Mr. Meadows, is even more extraordinary, considering that his character's complex psyche is woefully unexplored, and that there are long stretches in which he is absent from the screen. The main attraction is the gang of loathsome thugs who horribly mistreated Richard's mentally disabled younger brother years earlier, as they are at first harmlessly toyed with before meeting much direr fates at the hands of their personal grim reaper.  That bloody retribution makes "good guys" the equals  of the original wrongdoers is an overused moral, and this film, though told with style and authority, ultimately doesn't have anything fresh to say. Despite some hints at conscience and humanity, "Dead Man's Shoes" is a typical slasher film at the core; Richard even wears a mask as he cruelly and methodically picks off his victims.</text>
