      <text>“Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” is like a feature-length version of the television sitcom “My Name Is Earl,” only Canadian — and not funny. Set in the fictional Sunnyvale trailer park and based on an award-winning cable television show, the movie follows the exploits of three aging bottom feeders and their small circle of enablers. There’s Ricky (Robb Wells), a fast-talking fabulist with Elvis hair and a sticky-fingered daughter, Trinity (Lydia Lawson-Baird); Julian (John Paul Tremblay), a stoic drunk fixated on stealing large amounts of loose change; and the myopic Bubbles (Mike Smith), a helpless man-child whose kitten-infested shack is facing much-needed demolition. Populated by characters whose lives revolve around doping, boozing and cutting into one another’s lap dances, “Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” flirts with the mockumentary format without buying it a ring. The script (by Mr. Wells and Mike Clattenburg, who also directed) is more creative with profanity than plot, though Ricky’s post-incarceration attempts to reclaim his lady love (Lucy DeCoutere) are handled with unexpected sweetness. Let’s face it, though: what woman wouldn’t choose new breasts, a lesbian lover and a job at a “gentleman’s club” over a suitor who lives in a car? “Trailer Park Boys: The Movie” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has public urination, private lap dancing and universal bad taste.</text>
