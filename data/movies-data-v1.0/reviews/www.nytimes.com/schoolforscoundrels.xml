      <text> As an actor Billy Bob Thornton can do just about anything. If his Southern accent generally rules out roles like Fagin or Prince Hal, his delectable  leer suggests that  he might have made a more plausible Marquis de Sade than Geoffrey Rush some years back. That leer is much in evidence in the shoddy comedy “School for Scoundrels,” though the tackiness of the film, its lazy direction (from Todd Phillips, who did incomparably better with “Old School”) and its self-satisfied stupidity may mean that Mr. Thornton curled his lip about the production rather than for it. Whatever the case, this actor’s estimable talents are squandered here in a role to which he nevertheless brings a little customary oomph.  Part lifestyle coach and 100 percent huckster, Mr. Thornton’s character, Dr. P., the alpha scoundrel,  runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort often played by the other lead actor, Jon Heder. As Roger, a New York parking enforcement officer whom other men, with the usual panic about gender endemic to bonehead comedies, insist on calling a meter maid, Mr. Heder doesn’t lean as heavily on geek-shtick as he did in “Napoleon Dynamite.”  Yet if Mr. Heder has graduated from playing clowns who eat their own snot, as he did in “The Benchwarmers,” and now has a decent haircut, he has a ways to go before he can pass as the kind of guy who can win the affections of the pretty Australian next door (Jacinda Barrett). No matter. Roger gets the girl; we get this lousy movie.  “School for Scoundrels” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some crude language.</text>
