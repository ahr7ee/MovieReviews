      <text> Given its preoccupation with disease and calamity, "Look Both Ways" may not be the most soothing entertainment for these high-anxiety times and for audiences primed to flinch every time a car backfires. Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, the live-action movie follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. Before Monday morning, each will face the possibility of one or more of the following: unemployment, chemotherapy, abortion and death. I should probably mention it's a love story.  The principal sufferers, er, soul mates are Meryl (Justine Clarke), an illustrator of sympathy cards who's constantly imagining her own destruction, and Nick (William McInnes), a newspaper photographer who spends his days documenting disaster. The cheery pair meet at the site of a railway fatality, mere hours after Nick has been told he has testicular cancer. Prodded by a soundtrack crammed with limp ballads and the voice of a newscaster cataloging the deaths from yet another train accident, the two fall into bed, relieved to discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac.  Bogged down by the stylistic gimmickry of bustling montages and jarring animated segments, "Look Both Ways" aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company.  "Look Both Ways" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some animated violence and extremely nonanimated sex.</text>
