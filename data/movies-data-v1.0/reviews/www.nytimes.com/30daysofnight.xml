      <text> Adapted by the director David Slade from Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith’s graphic novel about vampires taking over an Alaska town, “30 Days of Night” is a series of gory set pieces that seems to have been edited with a meat ax. A major early transition is so clumsy that you may assume that the projectionist accidentally skipped a reel. No such luck: it’s a style thing.  After an intriguingly subdued opening section — which introduces the inhabitants of a town above the Arctic Circle that’s shrouded in darkness for one month a year — the movie crosscuts between the schemes of a predictably effete, nasty vampire horde (Eurotrash nightclub-crawler outfits, subtitled dialogue) and the besieged citizenry’s attempts to hide and fight.  Mr. Slade’s solid cast includes Josh Hartnett as the stalwart town sheriff; Melissa George as his estranged wife, a fire marshal; Mark Boone Junior  as his loutish, antisocial brother; Danny Huston as the flamboyantly cheesy vampire chieftain; and the impishly hammy Ben Foster as a prophecy-spouting jail inmate whose plot function recalls the similar, superior Stephen King mini-series “Storm of the Century.”  But the performers have little to do besides spill and drink blood in this tedious, inconsequential B picture. The sun doesn’t rise nearly fast enough.  “30 Days of Night” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong horror violence and language.</text>
