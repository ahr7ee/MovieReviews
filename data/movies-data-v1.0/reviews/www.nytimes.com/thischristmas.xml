      <text> In movies the holidays are a time when families come together, and a lifetime of secrets boil to the surface over a few short days.  In Preston A. Whitmore II’s film “This Christmas,” the Whitfields — a mother, her three sons, three daughters and two grandchildren — gather, along with various significant others, for a Christmas crammed with more melodrama than all the holiday-homecoming flicks from the past decade combined.  For starters, there are pregnancies, covert interracial marriages, gambling debts, new romances, divorces, repressed musical talents, bar brawls and catfights.  Boisterous and bittersweet, the film is  not  dull, but it does feel hopelessly overstuffed, with scant time to devote to any one story line.  There are also lapses in logic. For instance, one daughter states that people are afraid to hum in the presence of Mom, who blames music for stealing away her husband, just minutes after the family has engaged in a borderline-embarrassing dance-along to Kool &amp; the Gang’s “Get Down On It.” (Again, only in the movies.)  Before the closing credits, the gifted cast members again show off their moves in a dance sequence that might have better served as a DVD extra. But at least they’re having fun — more than audiences probably  will as they’re pounded over the head with this mostly formulaic holiday cheer.  “This Christmas” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has slight violence and naughty sexual talk.</text>
