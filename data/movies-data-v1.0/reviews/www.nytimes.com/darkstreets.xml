      <text>“Dark Streets” has atmosphere coming out its ears, but not much going on between them. Based on a stage musical by Glenn M. Stewart and brought to the screen by the director Rachel Samuels, this lush film noir musical spares no imaginative expense on the décor of sultry nightclubs, the density of fake fog on brooding streets, the lighting of Art Deco lobbies and the parade of sleek, glittering, sexed-up costumes that variously suggest the 1930s, haute couture sadomasochism and “Cabaret Beyond the Thunderdome.” It’s a whole lot to look  at, and there’s plenty to listen to as well: the score includes performances by Etta James, Aaron Neville and Chaka Khan. This music, mostly the blues, is pantomimed by the denizens of the Tower nightclub, who find themselves ensnared in a lackluster mystery involving the playboy owner, Chaz Davenport (Gabriel Mann), a shady police lieutenant (Elias Koteas) and a pair of femmes fatales (Bijou Phillips and Izabella Miko). Diverting enough as a series of music videos, “Dark Streets” strikes postures in place of drama. The plot, such as it is, seems like a pretext for the nonstop musical numbers; you can feel the energy slacken every time the spectacle pauses to register, ineffectually, a human presence or a story worth telling. “Dark Streets” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some sexual content, drug use and brief violent images.</text>
