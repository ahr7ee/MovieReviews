      <text>ate in the historical documentary "Watermarks," Hanni Lux, an Austrian Jewish athlete who participated in a pre-Olympic ceremony in Vienna just before the 1936 Berlin games, recalls the frightening reception  that  her group - members of  a Jewish sports club, Hakoah Vienna -  received during the torch-bearing ritual.  Following another delegation that was met  with a rapturous ovation, punctuated by cries of "Heil Hitler,"  her team,  from the  club's championship women's  swimming division, was greeted  with "a silence filled with fear," she says. "We felt mass hatred," she adds. "It really was one of my most horrible experiences."  Terrified, the team ran back to the clubhouse, shut the door and hugged and kissed for a reassurance that was to be found nowhere else. Ms. Lux is one of eight Austrian-born Jewish  female athletes, now in their 80's and scattered around the world, whom the director Yaron Zilberman gathered for a pilgrimage back to Vienna. At the end of the movie, they slip into the waters of an Olympic-size pool for a final communal lap. More than 65 years earlier, the Nazis had closed their beloved club and driven them into exile. The notion of a reunion staged for the camera may be a filmmaking stunt. But it provides the raison-d'�tre of a moving documentary that approaches the Holocaust from a fresh, intimate perspective.  Personal stories trump epic, fact-filled overviews almost every time. And as "Watermarks"  flashes continually back and forth between the women today and pictures of their youthful selves, it is hard not to put yourself in their 1930's shoes and imagine their ordeal. During the 1936 Olympics, Hanni's older sister, Judith, who now lives next door to her in Israel, faced a different humiliation. The most honored member of the Austrian swim team, she and two other members resigned from it rather than compete in Berlin. She was severely punished by the Austrian Sports Federation, which stripped her of her awards and struck her name from the record books. That recognition has since been restored. At another point late in the film, the women are serenaded in a Viennese club by a cabaret singer performing the ghastly "Buchenwald Song," whose composers, Fritz Beda-L�hner and Hermann Leopoldi, imprisoned in the concentration camp, were ordered to write   as a marching song for their fellow prisoners to sing. If the film never satisfactorily explains the reason for this ghoulish moment, it leaves the same sickening impression as Ms. Lux's memories of the pre-Olympic  ceremony. Much of the rest of the film, which opens today in New York, tells the inspiring story of Hakoah Vienna (hakoah means strength in Hebrew), which was founded in 1909 after a law was passed forbidding Austrian sports clubs to admit Jews. Until then, sports had not been central to Austrian Jewish culture, which had produced Freud and Mahler, among many world-class intellectuals and artists, but no athletes of note. The success of Hakoah Vienna helped end the traditional Jewish  indifference to  sports. Weeks after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, the club was shut down. But its leaders, who fled to London, succeeded in helping most of the members emigrate on illegal ships and kept the spirit of the club alive in  newsletters. As these women tell their stories in a tone of wonderment, "Watermarks" becomes more than  a pointed footnote to the Holocaust. It emerges as a surprisingly encouraging reflection on the distance between youth and advanced age. Despite their physical frailty, the spirit of these women, many of them honored professionals in a variety of fields, remains intact, and their joy at reconnecting outweighs their uneasiness at returning to the homeland that rejected them.</text>
