      <text>he familiar visual signposts of alienation are spiffily arrayed in Siegrid Alnoy's handsome but empty film debut, "She's One of Us." The reflective glass surfaces, the anonymous office buildings and the shopping mall where Christine Blanc (Sasha Andres), the movie's central character, spends hours sitting alone and gazing blankly (or "blanc-ly") into space, signify anomie with a capital A. Christine, who is 35 and resembles a fleshier Celine Dion, works as an office temp in a shabby provincial town in the Rh�ne Alps. Her dissociation from others is symbolized by any number of portentous cinematic maneuvers. The protracted silences, the lingering studies of pensive, unreadable faces and the shuffling of the actors into nearly motionless tableaus reveal Ms. Alnoy's enormous debt to Michelangelo Antonioni, who did similar things with a lighter touch and more metaphysical resonance 40 years ago. If the movie's severe visual style is hypnotic, once the elliptical story totters into motion it begins to mean less than meets the eye. At least Ms. Alnoy borrows from the best. The influence of Bruno Dumont, the brilliant director of "L'Humanit�," is also apparent in the meticulous soundtrack, which emphasizes uncomfortable noises, like Christine's heavy breathing. Like Mr. Dumont, Ms. Alnoy favors abrupt shifts of perspective in which characters whose faces have been clinically scrutinized are suddenly viewed from afar. And the scenes of Christine driving through a bleakly lovely winter landscape recall similar moments in Laurent Cantet's "Time Out." Ms. Andres's subtle portrayal of an attractive middle-class woman who can't fit into her surroundings except as an efficient cog in the corporate workplace goes as far as it can to lend the character a larger symbolic weight. Christine is so protective of her privacy that she lies to people about her living circumstances. For no apparent reason, she tells a live-in boyfriend that her father is dead. The drama revolves around Christine's sudden, awkward friendship with Patricia (Catherine Mouchet), the kindly woman from the employment agency that dispatches her on job interviews. After a casual conversation one afternoon, Christine impulsively invites Patricia home to her Spartan apartment for what she calls a potluck dinner but that turns out to be an elegant feast. Knowing Patricia collects ceramic owls,  Christine buys an entire collection ahead of time and presses one on her protesting guest. Christine's pent-up tension explodes when the two women visit a public swimming pool. During a minor altercation Christine pushes Patricia to the slippery tile floor where she cracks her head. Patricia's screams of agony drive Christine to silence her by lethally assaulting her with a fire extinguisher. The rest of the story is a halfhearted cat-and-mouse game in which Christine is pursued by two bumbling policemen and befriended by Degas (Carlo Brandt), a senior police officer who suspects her of homicide but is also attracted to her. Mr. Brandt's wide, radarlike gaze conveys the aura of a man who has seen too much horror. In the wake of the murder, Christine prospers. She lands a full-time job in the accounting department of a trucking company, wins the admiration of her boss, Danjard (Jacques Spiesser), is befriended by a co-worker, Pascale (Mireille Roussel), and finds an eccentric soul mate in her glum assistant, S�bastien (Pierre-F�lix Gravi�re). But these relationships, in which Christine covertly wreaks great harm, are too sketchy to make psychological sense. As it reaches an ending whose ambiguity recalls the conclusion of "Unfaithful," "She's One of Us" leaves you wondering what the point is. Is it a clinical portrait of a quirky sociopath? Or, as seems more likely, is Christine a symbol of the soul-deadening sterility of the modern corporate workplace? If it's a character study, the film is lost in vagueness. If Christine is a metaphor, she's a very tired one.</text>
