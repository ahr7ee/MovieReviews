      <text> Animated in name only, “Everyone’s Hero” is the uninspired tale of Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin), a 10-year-old baseball fanatic who finds himself in possession of Babe Ruth’s stolen bat, Darlin’ (a trash-talking Whoopi Goldberg). Accompanied by a wiseacre baseball named Screwie (Rob Reiner), Yankee travels from New York to Chicago and the 1932 World Series, where the Babe is striking out more often than Mel Gibson at a bat mitzvah. Soon Yankee has saved the Babe’s reputation, restored his father’s custodial job and persuaded Whoopi Goldberg to stop talking. Not even a ghostly Patrick Swayze managed that.  Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting — though the Negro leagues are granted a fleeting mention — “Everyone’s Hero” is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. Screwie and Darlin’ vocalize without back story or mythology. At least when Tom Hanks chatted to Wilson in “Cast Away,” the connection between human and volleyball was clearly understood.  Given that this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve (Christopher Reeve directed, along with Colin Brady and Dan St. Pierre, while Dana Reeve provided the voice of Yankee’s mother), “Everyone’s Hero” enters multiplexes already shadowed by tragedy. And while that may not be the best start for a kiddie feature, the movie’s sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn’t deserve.</text>
