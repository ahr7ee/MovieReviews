      <text> At Camp Kilpatrick a juvenile detention facility in the Santa Monica Mountains, there’s not a lot for inmates to do besides eat, sleep and beat up rival gang members. So when Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson, a k a the Rock), a probation officer and former delinquent, decides to form a football team, teaching the kids sportsmanship is the least of his problems. First they have to learn how to spell their team name.  “Gridiron Gang,” based on Lee Stanley’s 1993 documentary of the same name, is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its lawlessness and cure it too. Seething with violence — domestic, street and institutional — the movie jumps from heartwarming to murderous without ever convincing us that all these guys need is a coach who cares. They may have learned there’s no “I” in team, but breaking an opponent’s face is still in the playbook; and when a local Christian school agrees to a game, you know that Christians haven’t been in this much peril since ancient Rome.  Directed by Phil Joanou and filmed at the real Camp Kilpatrick, “Gridiron Gang” gains significant momentum from Jeff Cutter’s amped-up photography, most notably on the gridiron itself. But the movie’s good intentions are consistently undermined by its simplistic notion of redemption, and its inspirational thrust is diluted by an epilogue that suggests the program still has a ways to go in the life-altering department.  “Gridiron Gang” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has shootings in the street, brawls on the football field and swearing just about everywhere.</text>
