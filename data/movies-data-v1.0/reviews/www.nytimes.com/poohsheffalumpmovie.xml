      <text>n A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, written in the 1920's, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh running around with a honey jar stuck on his head. In "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," which is adorable, he finally encounters the real thing. And it (the heffalump) is too cute for words. With traditional Disney animation and the pastel colors of the Hundred Acre Wood,  where the Pooh tales  are set, Milne's characters gather again, reduced to simple personality types. Piglet is afraid, Eeyore is gloomy, Tigger is self-involved, little Roo is curious, and Pooh is Pooh, making excuses and being generally clueless. (When Piglet leaves a trail of jelly beans so they won't become lost in the forest, Pooh, not getting the idea, blithely eats them one by one as they go along.) The animals have heard a frightening noise coming from Heffalump Hollow and conclude that it must be one of the area's scary-monster namesakes. Everybody says heffalumps are very frightening, dangerous and mean, with spiky tails. But the group screws up its collective courage and sets out on an expedition to find and capture one. But it's little Roo, whom they consider too young to go along, who happens upon a heffalump, a very young one whose nickname is Lumpy. Roo explains to his find that he has come to capture him. Great, capture me, Lumpy says agreeably. At this point, adults as well as children may fall in love with Lumpy, partly because he's a sort of roly-poly lavender baby elephant but even more because of the endearing voice and infectious laugh of Kyle Stanger, a very young Briton making his movie and voice-over debut. The other voice-over actors do fine jobs, including Brenda Blethyn as Lumpy's considerably larger but equally gentle mother. And Carly Simon has written four charming children's songs for the film, three of which she performs. But in the end, it's all about Kyle, age 8, whom I would very much like to adopt. Roo persuades Lumpy to leave his part of the world and come over to the Hundred Acre Wood, where they romp, giggle and get into a little trouble. When the other animals come across the broken honey pots and the ravaged garden of pumpkins, watermelons and carrots they have left behind (the kids were hungry, O.K.?), they interpret it as destruction by a frightening creature and set out numerous traps. Two 4ï¿½-year-olds sitting in the row in front of me seemed to be enjoying the film. The loudest children's laughter in the theater followed Pooh's falling out of bed and into a honey pot, Tigger's falling on Rabbit and Rabbit's being tied up with rope from head to toe. The smallest moviegoers may not realize they are being taught a crucial lesson about fearing the unknown and the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you, but there it is. "He's just like us," Roo explains to his friends, who are initially terrified of Lumpy. "He gets afraid. He likes honey. He even learned how to bounce.</text>
