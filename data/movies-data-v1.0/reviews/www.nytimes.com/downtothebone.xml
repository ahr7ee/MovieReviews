      <text>"Down to the Bone," which won a Special Jury Prize at last year's Sundance Festival, is the kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem. Vera Farmiga gives a pitch-perfect performance as Irene, a mother of two who works as a supermarket cashier in upstate New York. Though she appears to be a competent employee and loving wife and mother, Irene's life is precariously built around  a cocaine addiction. When she finds herself trying to cash her son's birthday check to pay off her dealer, Irene decides to check herself into rehab. But an affair with a charismatic male nurse (Hugh Dillon) threatens to drag her into the even more dangerous world of heroin. The story was based on nearly five years' worth of video shot by the director, Debra Granik, and her cinematographer, Michael McDonough, documenting  a situation similar to Irene's. Ms. Granik writes dialogue that is spare enough to ring true, yet rich enough to flesh out every character, including Irene's young sons. She is also admirably rigorous in her avoidance of the pat narratives of abjection and redemption common in stories of  drug addiction. Even as Irene makes bad choices, she remains a sympathetic and intelligent character, and the film's ambiguous conclusion is as heartbreaking, and as hopeful, as real life.</text>
