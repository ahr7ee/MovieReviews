      <text> Ever since Kevin Bacon’s rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in “Footloose,” the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In the typical scenario, a boy from the wrong side of the tracks woos a socially superior girl, his only assets a killer smile and a limber pelvis. The story is as old as Mickey Rooney but its appeal is eternal, and “Step Up” cleaves to the template with significantly more rigor than originality. For a director who is also a choreographer, Anne Fletcher is strangely reluctant to step out of line.  This time, the rough boy with the street moves is Tyler (Channing Tatum), a genial Baltimore kid who spends his days stealing cars and shooting hoops. During a stint of community service at an arts school, Tyler is dazzled by a classically trained dancer named Nora (Jenna Dewan) and is soon awkwardly substituting for her injured partner. Obstacles abound — not the least of these being Nora’s unattractive rehearsal outfits — but no relationship based on perfect upper-body alignment can flounder for long. Not when there’s an end-of-term recital at stake. Dance, Tyler, dance!  Though most of the cast appears to be on its ninth repeat of 12th grade, “Step Up” is a likable product that’s refreshingly free of vulgarity. What it’s really about, of course, is class. Like “Save the Last Dance” and its predecessors, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can’t we all be friends?  “Step Up” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild innuendo, one violent incident, two girls who deserve better and no jazz hands whatsoever.</text>
