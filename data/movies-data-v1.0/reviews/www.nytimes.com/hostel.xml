      <text> Like many an ugly American before them, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are backpacking across Europe in search of loose women,  legal drugs and opportunities to bark obscenities at the locals. The first half of "Hostel," the  horror film by Eli Roth ("Cabin Fever"), is devoted to the stupid shenanigans of these repellent yahoos as they lurch from town to town, sucking down bong hits  and staggering through red-light districts saying things like, "I hope bestiality is legal in Amsterdam because that chick is a hog!" Charming.  The second half asks us to sympathize with them as they're snared in an underground Slovakian snuff club and graphically tortured by sadistic Euro crazies. It isn't easy.  Inspired by the brutal exploitation  pictures of the 1970's and the nasty new breed of Asian horror films, "Hostel" is motivated by an adolescent urge to shock. And while it's true that no civilized person will remain unscathed by the film's relentless bigotry  - this is one of the most misogynistic films ever made  -  Mr. Roth's gory spectacles are too calculated to deliver the transgressive  jolts they so obviously  seek.  A cameo appearance by Takashi Miike, the intermittently brilliant director of genre freakouts like "Ichi the Killer" and "Izo," drives home the essential timidity of Mr. Roth's vision. For all his vivid outrages and considerable filmmaking chops, he isn't pushing boundaries or unearthing fresh hells of the imagination. At the end of the day, if you've seen one  psychopath go to work in a basement abattoir, you've seen them all.  "Hostel" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It pushes the category to the limit with nonstop profanity, bigotry, drug use, nudity and a great deal of extremely graphic torture, dismemberment and murder.</text>
