      <text> Eyes popping and mouths agape, Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symoné mug their way through “College Road Trip” as if it were a silent movie — which, come to think of it, would have been a lot less irritating.  The latest in a genre that defines comedy as nothing more than extreme overreaction, the movie hangs its feeble plot on James Porter (Mr. Lawrence), a domineering police chief who’d like to see his teenage daughter, Melanie (Raven-Symoné), on permanent lockdown. Doting to the point of derangement, James has already chosen her college — Northwestern — based on its proximity to home and his smothering attentions. Sensibly, Melanie plans to interview at Georgetown; naturally, Daddy insists on driving; thankfully, the movie’s target audience will be too young to have heard of Freud.  Directed by Roger Kumble (who has fallen very far from “Cruel Intentions”), “College Road Trip” trawls for laughs with a chess-playing pig and a bus filled with karaoke-singing Japanese tourists. As James crashes a wedding and storms a sorority house (to rescue Melanie from ...  a pajama party), his obsession with her borders on the disturbing. By the time Donny Osmond and Molly Ephraim show up to play a parent-child combo that’s scarier than the one embodied by Anthony Perkins in “Psycho,” you’ll be wishing that the pig had eaten the screenplay.</text>
