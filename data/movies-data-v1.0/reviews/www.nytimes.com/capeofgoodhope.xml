      <text> The kind-hearted triumph and the wicked get theirs in "Cape of Good Hope," a genuine uplift of a film that even the most diehard cynics will find hard to resist. Set in gorgeous Cape Town, Mark Bamford's energizing first feature revolves around a group of animal-shelter workers and their significant counterparts, as they contend with varying states of loneliness and gaping voids in their lives.  In addition to the abandoned dogs that yearn for food, homes and affection, a Muslim couple struggle to have a baby, while a refugee from Congo (played by the tremendously charismatic Eriq Ebouaney) must choose between a long-awaited chance for "freedom" (a ticket to Canada) and his love for a woman and her young son. And in the central storyline, the good-natured local veterinarian, who lost his wife to cancer, finds himself drawn to Kate (Debbie Brown), the emotionally frigid shelter founder, who is in turn carrying on a self-destructive relationship with a married scoundrel.  Though issues of race, immigration and gender politics are ever so tactfully present, Mr. Bamford never force-feeds lectures or clich√©s. Instead, he admirably adheres to his primary objective of concentrating on his large cast of compelling and utterly believable characters. Witnessing Kate thaw out is just one of the many pleasures this satisfying and memorable film has to offer.  "Cape of Good Hope" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language, sexual content and violence. (No animals are killed.</text>
