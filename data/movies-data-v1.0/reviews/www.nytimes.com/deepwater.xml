      <text> “Deep Water,” a fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy’s Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy.  The film follows Donald Crowhurst, who had “messed about in boats” but probably had no business entering the race, sponsored by The Sunday Times of London in 1968. Still,  Mr. Crowhurst got a press agent and an  investor, to whom he basically sold his soul, and was soon an underdog contender.  Trouble started immediately. His untried boat, fitted out with his own inventions, leaked and began to fall apart, leaving him with two options: He could turn back and face almost certain financial ruin or go ahead and face almost certain death. Instead he began lying about his progress. And he began to come unhinged. (“Now equal footing mermaids stop,” one telegram read.)  “Deep Water” makes haunting use of 16-millimeter film shot by Mr. Crowhurst and others in the race. There are also recordings of his voice and excerpts from his log, which goes from eloquent descriptions of his trials and loneliness to sounding a bit like Mr. Kurtz.  Again and again you want to shout at the screen: “Turn back. All will be forgiven.” This tale of risk, though, ends not with man conquering nature but in calamitous failure.  “Deep Water” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has dark themes and some mild swearing.</text>
