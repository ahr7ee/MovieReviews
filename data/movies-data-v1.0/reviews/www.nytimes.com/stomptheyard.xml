      <text> Brotherhood is powerful. That’s the message of “Stomp the Yard,” a strange and at times strangely compelling mix of black fraternity recruitment video and inspirational tale about a hip-hop boy in a stepping world.  After a dance-off ends with a fight and murder, DJ leaves Los Angeles and krumping for Atlanta and stepping. At Truth University (go, Truth!), the all-black school where he enrolls, stepping — that combination of precision dancing, marching and chanting done in African-American fraternities and sororities — rules, and Gammas and Thetas are the Sharks and Jets.  DJ (the engaging Columbus Short) stands out: he’s a work-study student among the haute bourgeoisie and a street-style dancer among steppers (though it can be difficult to differentiate styles in the frenetically edited dance sequences). “Stomp the Yard” means to be a fable about finding your place in the group (a primal college story, after all) and succeeds most when it hews closest to genre formulas, showing a milieu rarely glimpsed on film, and least when it too warmly embraces fraternity culture.  Here, frat affiliation is lifelong and a predictor of success, with a pedigree so echt it includes the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But race and social justice are incidental to the Gammas and Thetas and to “Stomp,” which posits a world in which white people exist only to fill seats in upscale restaurants. DJ doesn’t need to change the world, he just needs to find a way to dance in it.  “Stomp the Yard” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is a little violence, a little sex and a lot of stepping.</text>
