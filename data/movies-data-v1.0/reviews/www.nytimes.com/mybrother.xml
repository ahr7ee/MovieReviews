      <text> "My Brother" is billed as the tale of two poor, orphaned siblings, the aspiring standup comic Isaiah (Nashawn Kearse) and the developmentally disabled James (Christopher Scott). It wants to be much more than that. At times it seems to want to counter 15 years' worth of Mayhem-N-the-Hood stereotypes all by itself, folding in commentary on the theological conundrums involved in accepting Down syndrome as God's will; the bond of Otherness shared by African-Americans and nonwhite Third World citizens; the perils of interracial romance; and the proper social function of standup comedy.  "My Brother," written and directed by Anthony Lover, suffers from organizational problems, overly expository dialogue and a tendency to overreach (particularly a subplot in which Isaiah accepts a job as a courier for  shady-seeming Middle Easterners and ends up embroiled in lame intrigue).  But its earnest tone, moving orchestral score (by John Califra) and strong cast (including Vanessa L. Williams, seen in flashbacks as the boys' fiercely devoted mother) carry it past the rough patches. And from the early scene in which James makes himself a sandwich while absentmindedly dancing to hip-hop, "My Brother" anchors sentiment to reality.  The movie's strongest element is the chemistry between the reflective Mr. Kearse and  Mr. Scott (who really has Down syndrome). Improving on its obvious antecedent in "Dominick and Eugene," their relationship feels real, not like a movie contrivance.  "My Brother" is rated  PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence and mild profanity.</text>
