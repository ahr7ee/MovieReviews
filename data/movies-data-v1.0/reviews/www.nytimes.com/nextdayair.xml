      <text> Because “Next Day Air” concerns stoners, thieves, thugs, drug dealers, crackheads, slackers, prostitutes and a Mexican crime lord named Bodega Diablo (Emilio Rivera), it isn’t likely to be appreciated as one of the liveliest revivals of a dormant genre since “Unforgiven” woke the western.  But with a script that snaps, characters that pop, a blaze of streetwise attitude and enough firepower to pulverize a significant chunk of South Philadelphia, “Next Day Air” nears neo-blaxploitation perfection. Good things come in strange packages.  The screenplay, a feat of textural and structural inventiveness by Blair Cobbs, sets in motion a complex underworld farce after a box of high-grade cocaine, improbably shipped from Mexico through an overnight delivery service, is dropped off at the wrong address in a ramshackle Philadelphia apartment building.  Benny Boom, an established director of hip-hop music videos, deftly coordinates a half-dozen intersecting plotlines played to the hilt by an inspired ensemble of character actors. Donald Faison, Mike Epps, Wood Harris, Cisco Reyes, Yasmin Deliz, Omari Hardwick, Darius McCrary and Mos Def inhabit their roles with distinct verbal and physical flair, meshing with a rhythmic precision worthy of the Wu-Tang Clan in its heyday.  Violent and profane but never vulgar or inhuman, “Next Day Air” riffs on the disreputable with respect.  “Next Day Air” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for pervasive language, drug content, some violence and brief sexuality.</text>
