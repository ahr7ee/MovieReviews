      <text> "You can't hold a gun if you're holding an air guitar."  That Cheech and Chong sentiment is the manifesto of this documentary's title subculture, in which pantomiming  aspiring rockers compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! — but not necessarily in that order.  It sounds like the premise of a reality show. Sure enough, according to news releases, this breezy 82-minute movie is descended from an aborted VH-1 series overseen by Magical Elves Productions, the makers of "Project Runway" and "Last Comic Standing." Stylistically, it's nothing special, apart from its T-shirt-ready freeze-frames and lucid, playful editing (by Conor O'Neill). Like "Spellbound," "Murderball" and other competition documentaries, it's a valentine to underdog dreamers: "Rocky" gone basic cable.  But the movie's wild performances and droll humor are tough to resist. So are its obsessive yet self-mocking heroes: the Los Angeles-based actor David  Jung, who performs as C-Diddy, who has a kung phooey stage persona and wears a Hello Kitty pouch like a warrior's breastplate; and the New York writer-musician Dan Crane, a k a Björn Turöque, whose parched wit and jackhammer performance style suggest Bill Murray trapped in the body of Sid Vicious. Mr. Crane also wrote and sang the closing credits theme, a garage band anthem that lodges in the brain like a fishhook.  "Air Guitar Nation" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and some adult (if not necessarily mature) themes.</text>
