      <text> Ever since Bram Stoker gave Count Dracula a Transylvanian lineage, Eastern Europe has been a familiar setting for horror tales. "Severance" continues the tradition by turning a corporate retreat in a Hungarian forest into a bloody game of whack-a-mole. (Team building and paintballing are so last year.)  Our unsuspecting moles are a grumpy group of pencil-pushers employed by an international weapons manufacturer who find themselves marooned in a rundown lodge. Outside are land mines, bear traps and balaclava-wearing commandos; inside are spiders, rotting floorboards and a file cabinet with dusty records of the attackers, who are either asylum escapees or Balkan war criminals. Kind of a Hobson's choice, really.  Briskly directed by Christopher Smith (who also contributed to the screenplay), "Severance" overcomes its narrative deficiencies with inventive bloodletting and no small amount of wit. (A scene involving resourceful call girls and a lifeline made of lingerie is particularly impressive.)  The film's political argument may be broad, even if there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard.  Mr. Smith's visual technique, however, is exceedingly sharp, giving the film a dizzying sense of threat and disorientation.  Despite thinly drawn characters and a predictable order of fatalities (look out, socially awkward nerd!), "Severance" is a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think.  "Severance" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has decapitation, dismemberment, drugs and scantily clad women.</text>
