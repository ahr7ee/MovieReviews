      <text> Set in Hong Kong just before the city’s return to Chinese rule, “Flash Point” plays like the last hurrah of a criminal underclass facing the inevitable shrinking of its bottom line.  Yet the director, Wilson Yip, having located his film at this volatile political crossroads, proceeds to ignore its possibilities. Instead he confines himself to cheering the unorthodox policing methods of his hero, Ma Jun (Donnie Yen). Flippantly dismissing departmental concerns about his use of excessive force, Ma doggedly pursues his lowlife targets like a souped-up Dirty Harry. When his undercover partner (Louis Koo) is exposed and almost killed, justification for Ma’s brutality is no longer required.  A sequel of sorts to Mr. Yip’s film “S.P.L.” (released in the United States as “Kill Zone”), “Flash Point” attaches coldly professional visuals to a narrative so baffling that it’s rarely clear who is pounding on whom or why. Kidnappings, car chases and extended fight scenes — including the shockingly violent murder of a child — are executed with eye-popping proficiency, but the fluid action choreography (directed by Mr. Yen) never surmounts the superficiality of the script. Undercurrents of racial tension between the Chinese cops and their Vietnamese prey remain unexplored, and women are used strictly to remind us that killers are human too. Even Dirty Harry had a mom.</text>
