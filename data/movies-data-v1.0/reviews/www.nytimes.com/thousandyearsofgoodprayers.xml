      <text> “A Thousand Years of Good Prayers” is a gentle, pleasantly unrushed piece of moviemaking. There’s a tonic simplicity to how it gets the job done, and if the film comes off as fairly conventional stuff, it nevertheless succeeds on its own modest, middlebrow terms.  Directed by Wayne Wang (“The Joy Luck Club”) from a screenplay adapted by Yiyun Li from her own short story, “A Thousand Years” stars Henry O as Mr. Shi, an elderly Beijing gentleman who pays a visit to his daughter in America. Yilan (Faye Yu) leads a prosperous, assimilated life in a generic suburb, and greets her father with a mix of affection and trepidation.  Father and daughter both have skeletons in their closets, and the movie generates much of its feeling from their efforts to muffle the rattling. When Yilan heads off to work (and to bittersweet romantic rendezvous), her father pores over the newspaper or sits on a bench in the nearby park, where he strikes up a poignant friendship with a matronly Iranian immigrant (touchingly played by Vida Ghahremani).  “A Thousand Years” studies the subtle day-to-day tensions between Mr. Shi and Yilan before building, in its circumspect way, to a big emotional resolution. A more ambitious film might have forgone this predictable denouement; a less accomplished one would have fumbled its touching sincerity.</text>
