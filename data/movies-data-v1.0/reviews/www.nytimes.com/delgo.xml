      <text> In the fictional land of Jhamora, the earthbound Lockni natives have come to distrust the winged Nohrin immigrants (a shared fondness for the silent “h” notwithstanding). So when a Lockni lad named Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.) develops a crush on the Nohrin princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), her resemblance to Paula Abdul and his to a mottled potato are the least of their problems.  Plundering the imaginations of Anne McCaffrey, Peter Jackson, George Lucas and Shakespeare, this barely animated fantasy suffers from more than just a lack of originality. Dreary battles and apathetic voice work — only Eric Idle, as a malaprop-prone servant, earns his fee — conspire in a sedition-oriented plot that not even six writers (including the directors, Marc F. Adler and Jason F. Maurer) are able to invigorate.  Too leaden for adults and too baffling for kids (a gambling soldier whines about “the vig”), “Delgo” has a lumbering, prehistoric vibe fueled by dinosaur-derived creatures and images of intimidating density. Louis Gossett Jr.’s dignified baritone, emanating from the Nohrin king — whose bone structure recalls the alien played by Mr. Gossett in “Enemy Mine” — is no match for Chris Kattan’s grating contribution as Delgo’s shrieking sidekick, Filo. If only the evil empress Sedessa had crushed him beneath her heel instead of that innocent Lockni baby.  “Delgo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wicked aunt, an endless war and unnecessarily tight unitards.</text>
