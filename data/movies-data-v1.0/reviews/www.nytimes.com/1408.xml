      <text> A troubled writer, a haunted hotel room â€” who else but Stephen King? In "1408," adapted from a 2002 short story by Mr. King, John Cusack is the hack who drags his emotional baggage to Room 1408 of the  Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan, accommodations  whose history of grisly deaths demands investigation. Once there, he learns that checking out might not be an option.  Directed by Mikael Hafstrom with old-fashioned restraint and a stylish use of intense close-ups, "1408" is more psychological thriller than outright horror. Recycling many of Mr. King's familiar motifs, the story traps its protagonist in an apparitional loop filled with repeating signs of occult infestation: a Carpenters song bursting from a bedside radio, paintings that tilt and transform. The movie is most effective in its early scenes of prickly menace, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the haunted hotel in "The Shining"), its old-world creepiness is exactly right.  Mr. King is a writer who excels at finding malevolence in the mundane, and consequently his tortured Everymen have often been more successful on the small screen than on the large. Mr. Cusack's character descends directly from David Soul's in "Salem's Lot": scarred heroes who have lost their faith. In Mr. Cusack's case, it's waiting for him behind the door of 1408.  "1408" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The hero faces fire, flood, vertigo and assorted supernatural entities.</text>
