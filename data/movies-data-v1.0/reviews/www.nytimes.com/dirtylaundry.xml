      <text> “Dirty Laundry,” the second feature by the writer and director Maurice Jamal, is a back-to-your-roots film about a gay African-American named Sheldon (Rockmond Dunbar) who meets a young son (Aaron Grady Shaw) he didn’t know he had, and revisits his extended family in an intolerant Southern town he once fled in the name of self-respect.  Mr. Jamal’s direction ranges from clumsy to competent, and the film’s overwhelming desire to be loved blunts any edge it might have had. Fortunately, even as Mr. Jamal’s characters hit notes reminiscent of a half-baked television pilot, they disclose eccentricities that his cast spins into comic gold.  Sheldon — who now goes by his middle name, Patrick — is a borderline insufferable urban sophisticate. His lover, Ryan (Joey Costello), seems a stereotypical worshipful boy toy, but soon reveals deep reserves of empathy and political savvy. Sheldon’s brother Eugene (played by the director) pronounces the adjective “fancy” as if it were a slur, but he’s a hard worker, devoted husband and essentially decent man. Sheldon’s Aunt Lettuce (Jenifer Lewis) is a drama queen who treats every church appearance as a combination fashion show and “American Idol” tryout.  The standout, however, is Loretta Devine as Sheldon’s mother, Evelyn, a fussbudget, chain smoker and world-class chef who proves that a mom’s love conquers all.  “Dirty Laundry” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language, some sexual content and thematic elements.</text>
