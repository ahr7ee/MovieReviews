      <text> The romantic clich√© that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about a mentally ill man whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living songwriter. The youngest son of a fundamentalist Christian family from Virginia, Daniel Johnston grew up with a compulsion to create, churning out Super-8 films, comic-book-style drawings and cassette tapes full of songs and stories. But in college, he began to exhibit symptoms of manic-depression and grandiosity before running away to join a traveling carnival. He wound up in Austin, Tex., where his homemade cassettes of plaintive folk songs made a splash on the underground music scene.  After a brief stint as a curiosity on MTV, Mr. Johnston became a minor celebrity as a self-taught singer-songwriter, but he spent the 90's in a downward spiral, alternating between stays in mental hospitals and brushes with the law. Now in his mid-40's, Mr. Johnston lives with his parents in Texas and continues to make music with a local band, but, as he announces in the film's opening voice-over, he considers himself little more than "the ghost of Daniel Johnston." Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best-director award at the 2005 Sundance festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs.  "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" is rated PG-13 for thematic elements, drugs  and language, including a sexual reference.</text>
