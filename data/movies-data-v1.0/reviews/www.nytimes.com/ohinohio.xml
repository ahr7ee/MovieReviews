      <text> “The Oh in Ohio” is that rare American sex comedy that doesn’t involve teenagers making love to pastry. Directed by Billy Kent from a screenplay by Adam Wierzbianski, this nicely naughty indie is full of unexpected pleasures, not least the casting of Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to “liberate your labia!”  One such “sexually dysfunctional” woman is Priscilla Chase (Parker Posey), a Cleveland advertising executive who has never had an orgasm. Her marriage to Jack (Paul Rudd), a high school biology teacher, has suffered as a result, and the movie is concerned with the connections they make after separating.  He will seek happiness in the arms of a precociously bodacious student embodied by Mischa Barton. She will venture on a stimulating voyage of self-discovery that begins with vibrator advice from the hottest lesbian sex-shop clerk in the history of cinema (Heather Graham) and ends on a water slide with Danny DeVito, here giving a marvelously gentle performance as a roly-poly swimming pool salesman.  A feel-good movie about feeling good, “The Oh in Ohio” thrums with happy vibes and amiable performances. A delectable if limited actress, Ms. Posey locates a few real feelings within her usual goofball shtick. Ditto, in a less realized role, the hammy Mr. Rudd.</text>
