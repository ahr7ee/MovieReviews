      <text> Like an annoying new puppy, “Sherman’s Way” just wants to run around in circles and lick your face. After a while, though — and against your better judgment — you kind of fall in love with it.  Not that either of this movie’s lead characters, an elitist Yalie and a washed-up Olympian, is particularly admirable. As Sherman, a recent law school graduate and uptight mama’s boy, Michael Shulman embodies the kind of preppy privilege that’s a liability almost anywhere but Manhattan. But it’s James Le Gros,  playing a disgruntled former ski champion named Palmer, who finally pulls you in: his shaggy charm cushions both Sherman’s neuroses and the script’s manipulations.  The pair meet when Sherman, stranded in California after an impetuous decision goes awry, needs a ride to an internship in Beverly Hills. Enter Palmer with a stolen MGB roadster, a carpe diem mentality and a character arc as visible as his immaturity.  Nevertheless the director, Craig Saavedra, generates surprising warmth from the familiar tropes of the odd-couple road movie.  Shooting mostly in the verdant sweep of California’s wine country — and with a superb supporting cast — he allows Mr. Le Gros room to engage. Palmer may be an emotional infant but he can lick my face any time.</text>
