      <text> An unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" follows the release of the similarly themed "Yours, Mine &amp; Ours" by a month, making any rationale for its existence all the more dubious. Sure, there always seems to be room for more lightweight family fare during the holiday season, but this messy blend of silly slapstick and oversentimentality probably won't please children, teenagers or adults.  In this edition, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, which is also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). Pairing Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy, whose characters' competitive antics are more infantile than those of their 20 combined children, could have produced some much-needed verve. But even they fail to inspire anything more than the occasional smile. In fact, Mr. Martin, whose presence alone made the first film tolerable, is irritatingly hyperactive, as if trapped in "wild and crazy guy" mode for no apparent reason - while his perfect wife (Bonnie Hunt) gazes at him adoringly, raising neither voice nor eyebrow, as the mayhem wreaked by her rambunctious family and pet dog escalates.  This is a tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Surprisingly, Carmen Electra, as Mr. Levy's third, much younger, airheaded wife, strikes the closest resemblance to anything human.  "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some slightly raunchy humor.</text>
