      <text>n "Torremolinos 73," the charming debut feature film of the Spanish director Pablo Berger, Alfredo Lopez (Javier C�mara) is a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman in Spain during the Franco era, struggling to make ends meet while his wife, Carmen (Candela Pe�a), dreams of having a baby. On a business trip, Alfredo's boss, Don Carlos (Juan Diego), tells the couple of his latest publishing project: a "World Encyclopedia of Reproduction," to be shot on Super-8 film and marketed in Scandinavian countries. At first, Alfredo and Carmen shy away from the idea of making and starring in their own amateur porn film, but desperate for money, they agree to participate in Don Carlos's experiment. To their surprise, Alfredo and Carmen soon find they have previously unsuspected gifts: he, for directing erotic films, and she, for acting in them. Before long, they are swimming in cash and - to Carmen's discomfort - being recognized in public by star-struck Scandinavian travelers. Still, the couple fail to conceive a child, which leaves Carmen increasingly depressed as Alfredo withdraws into his work. When they head to an off-season tourist resort to film Alfredo's "masterpiece," a Bergmanesque sex film called "Torremolinos 73," an unexpected turn of events brings them to a crisis. This film's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like "A Hole in My Heart"; like Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," this is an affectionate portrait of the artist as a movie-mad amateur. Mr. C�mara, whom viewers will recognize as the nurse obsessed with a comatose patient in Pedro Almod�var's film "Talk to Her," gives an exquisitely calibrated performance as a beleaguered Everyman who discovers himself behind the viewfinder of a movie camera, while Ms. Pe�a is equally perfect as the initially repressed, then irrepressible Carmen. The long, conflict-free middle section of the film, which includes musical montages of clips from Alfredo's contributions to the encyclopedia, slackens the pace a bit. But "Torremolinos 73" is such a joyous celebration of sex and filmmaking that viewers will forgive its director for taking time out to enjoy a little of both.</text>
