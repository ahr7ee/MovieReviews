      <text> In 1999 you could explain Troy Duffy’s “Boondock Saints” as a cheeseball riff on “Reservoir Dogs” and “True Romance” — Quentin Tarantino meets Wayne and Garth. How to explain, a decade later, his “Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day”? Apparently the world has been waiting for another cartoonishly violent, broadly comic Boston Irish Catholic vigilante action movie with gay overtones.  Mr. Duffy has reunited an impressive share of the original cast, starting with Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers, the slaughterhouse workers turned righteous avengers who liquidated crowds of Russian and Italian mobsters in the original. Flushed from their hideout in Ireland, they rejoin their bumbling allies on the Boston police force and ventilate some more goodfellas, this time Italian and Chinese. Sadly, Willem Dafoe’s gay F.B.I. agent is gone, replaced by Julie Benz doing a hybrid Kyra Sedgwick-Sharon Stone impression. In an indicator of Mr. Duffy’s comic sensibility, she wears a gun prominently strapped just above her crotch.  Mr. Duffy again tells his story through successive here’s-what-happened flashbacks and indulges in extreme movie love, emulating blaxploitation and Hong Kong cop films and quoting everything from “The Godfather” to “Titanic” to “Basic Instinct.” And at least a quarter of his relentless gags may make you laugh. Like its predecessor, “All Saints Day” will, if nothing else, be a cult item for Roman Catholic schoolboys; the next sequel, blatantly set up, should arrive no later than 2019.  “The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody violence, language and some nudity.</text>
