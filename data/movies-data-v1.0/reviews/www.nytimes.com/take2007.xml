      <text> Late into “Take” comes a teasing suggestion that much of what we’ve seen thus far has been imagined, to some extent, in the minds of its ill-fated characters. Subjective or not, the movie is a bore and an eyesore. If there is anything the cinema needed less than another angst-ridden, cross-cutting tragedy about crime, fate, memory and redemption, it’s the kind  shot in an ugly monochromatic palette suggesting a world drained of emotions and filmmakers parched of imagination.  Written and directed by Charles Oliver, “Take” stars Minnie Driver as Ana, a working-class mom with a hyperactive child (Bobby Coleman), and Jeremy Renner as Saul, a compulsive gambler at the end of his rope. We glean, from an early jumble of images that foretells much brooding montage to come,  that their crossing of paths results in a terrible act of violence.  Bits and pieces of the story merge and splinter, compelled less by the psychological fissures of the characters than by a screenplay that wails with emotionalism but fails to generate any real feeling. Saul passes his final hours on death row in the company of a priest who drones clichés, while Ana motors along a memory-strewn desert en route to his execution: two tortured souls fated for one last encounter. And one torturous drama put out of its misery.  “Take” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is violent child endangerment and torture of the audience.</text>
