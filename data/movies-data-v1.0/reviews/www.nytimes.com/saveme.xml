      <text> Correction Appended  “Save Me” establishes a clumsy dialectical agenda straight (so to speak) out of the gate, crosscutting between a day in the life of Mark (Chad Allen), a cocaine-addled young man with a taste for messy sex in cheap motels, and a group of hymn-singing churchgoers with affiliations to the Genesis House, a retreat devoted to converting gay men to heterosexuality. Mark, hitting rock bottom, is shuffled off to Genesis by his brother, and with a quickness made possible less by the power of Jesus than by schematic screenwriting, casts aside his old habits and cheerfully embraces shiny, happy asexuality.  And yet, as the unreconstructed gay might say, look out, girl! Here comes Scott (Robert Gant), a hunky fellow resident, and the next thing you know Mark and Scott are kicking it with Satan over cigarettes and furtive man-on-man action.  Directed by Robert Cary from a screenplay by Robert Desiderio that never quite shakes off its aura of second-rate made-for-TV movie, “Save Me” has a lot of heart but little nerve and no surprise.  Judith Light is very good as Gayle, the stern yet loving mistress of Genesis house. But like everyone in the picture, she’s saddled with a reductive motivation (a gay son lost to suicide) that undercuts the film’s genuine sympathy for the emotional hazards of gay life.</text>
