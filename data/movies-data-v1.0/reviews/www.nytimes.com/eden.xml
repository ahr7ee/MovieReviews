      <text> The kitchen-sink drama has fallen out of favor lately, elbowed aside by flashier fare. One welcome corrective to this trend is “Eden,” a picture so modest and minor-key that the emotional bruise it leaves may take days to develop.  Set in an anonymous Irish town where bars and busybodies are the primary sources of information, “Eden” circles the rocky marriage of Billy (Aidan Kelly, heartbreaking) and Breda (Eileen Walsh), a 10-year union that has produced two children and a number of dissatisfactions. As their anniversary celebration looms, Billy — a balding, bored phone company worker — grasps at youth in the form of the fiery Imelda (Sarah Greene), while Breda would just really like to have sex again, preferably some time this century.  Exquisitely tuned to the terrors of approaching middle age, “Eden” takes as its subject the common wounds of the neglected marriage and their all-too-familiar field dressings: the diet and haircut for her, the itchy feet and alcoholic stupor for him. Less gritty than Ken Loach and less quirky than Mike Leigh, the director, Declan  Recks (working from a script by Eugene O’Brien, adapting his stage play), sacrifices novelty for emotional honesty, and his actors respond.  “What if that’s all there is?” asks Breda of a friend after recounting an erotic dream. Neither woman has an answer.</text>
