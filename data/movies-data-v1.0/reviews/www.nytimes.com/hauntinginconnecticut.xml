      <text> Spinning another based-on-actual-events tale of a family ejected  from its  home by angry spirits, “The Haunting in Connecticut” gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure.  When the Campbells (headed by Virginia Madsen and Martin Donovan) discover that their rickety Connecticut rental is a former funeral parlor, it’s left to the family’s terminally ill son (Kyle Gallner, earnestly moping) to handle the disgruntled former clients. Apparently their mortician liked to do more than just embalm.  Aside from the presence of the usual corny cleric (here played on the level by Elias Koteas), the movie  refers to “Psycho,” “The Shining” and “The Exorcist” by way of Amityville. But these mnemonics are far less distracting than the endlessly prompting, screeching score. Stories like this need hush to work: the rustle of a shroud and the dry whisper of ghostly conversation can’t compete with shrieking violins.  Directing his first feature, Peter Cornwell delivers some genuinely grisly imagery: a rusty tin filled with eyelid trimmings — their lashes still attached — and a spew of brocadelike ectoplasm. Most unsettling of all are the peaceful photographs of dead people that link the movie’s parallel worlds; as the Icelandic filmmaker Hrabba Gunnarsdottir proved in her mesmerizing documentary “Corpus Camera,” images of the deceased can provide a great deal more than closure.  “The Haunting in Connecticut” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Food turns into water, water turns into blood and corpses turn into insulation.</text>
