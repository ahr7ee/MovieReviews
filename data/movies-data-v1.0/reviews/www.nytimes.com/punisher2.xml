      <text> “Who punishes you?” someone asks Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson), better known as the Punisher, in the punishing new entertainment called “Punisher: War Zone.”  It’s a fair enough question, but the one I had as I sat through 107 bloody, grinding minutes was a little different: What did I ever do to deserve this?  Dumb question, I know. It’s silly to take the brutality of “Punisher: War Zone,” which is based on a comic book with a devoted following, seriously or personally. Guys get their heads blown off, or severed, or pierced with chair legs, or pulverized with fists, because that’s what they have coming and that’s what the fan base will pay money to see. But does it have to be so witless, so stupid, so openly contemptuous of the very audience it’s supposed to be pandering to?  More dumb questions! I understand that the picture, directed with grisly intensity by Lexi Alexander, is a big, bloody cartoon. At its center is a grim, humorless avenger whose nemesis is a onetime mobster named Jigsaw (Dominic West), so called because his face was disfigured in a recycling accident. Jigsaw has a crazy brother named Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) — but, really, why bother? You will see this movie or not, and it will make about as much sense to you either way. There is, however, one line that is, if not quite clever, at least relevant for the purposes of concluding this review. As the Punisher says to a bad guy he’s about to waste, “I guess I’ll put you out of my misery.”  “Punisher: War Zone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing and extremely graphic killing.</text>
