      <text> In “Beerfest,” a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard have created a frat-house staple for the ages. The plot — an insanitary blend of hops, ram urine and human remains — follows the Wolfhouse brothers (Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter) to Oktoberfest, where they stumble into an underground beer-guzzling contest and abject humiliation at the hands of their German cousins.  To defend the family name, the brothers return a year later with their dream team: a beer-games champ and erstwhile male prostitute (Jay Chandrasekhar, who also directs), a hollow-legged chugging machine (Kevin Heffernan) and a lab technician (Steve Lemme) whose specialty is collecting frog ejaculate — a decidedly unscientific process that the movie’s target audience will enjoy almost as much as the frogs do.  As the team faces off against belligerent British sailors, aggressive Aussies and a pair of Teutonic bingers known as Hammacher and Schlemmer, the movie, like its characters, becomes increasingly incoherent. Fortunately there’s Great Gam Gam (a delicious Cloris Leachman, dusting off her Frau Blücher accent from “Young Frankenstein”), the brothers’ steely great-grandmother with the nefarious past. “I always sleep better when I have some sausage in me,” she confides, lasciviously stroking a frankfurter. It’s the classiest moment in the movie.  “Beerfest” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It abuses language, drugs, alcohol, human beings and small amphibians, sometimes all at once.</text>
