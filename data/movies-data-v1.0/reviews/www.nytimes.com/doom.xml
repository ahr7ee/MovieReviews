      <text> In "Doom," an estranged brother and sister meet on Mars, where she is a forensic archaeologist and he is a soldier sent to quell an uprising of mutants. Desperate to humanize the characters in this video game turned action flick, the writers came up with this bit of tension, when Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) chides her gifted brother for squandering his intellect: "Does it ever bother you that you could have spent your life looking into a microscope instead of a sniper scope?"  We expect a moral from a tale about the Grimms, but this claustrophobic mess of a movie offers only carnage. Well, somewhere in there is a bit of preachiness about tampering with DNA, and later, there's a vignette about military power run amok. But this spectacle is really just a formulaic shoot'em-up, with dead bodies amassing on the floor of an underground Martian laboratory.  Dwayne Johnson, the pro wrestler known as the Rock who now acts in movies, relies on his musculature and expressive eyebrows to play Sarge, a trigger-happy troop leader. ("We kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out," Sarge tells his troops.) Ms. Pike is convincing only in her desperation to flee the dark chambers of the space outpost, a dash for the exits that audiences will understand all too well.  "Doom" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic decapitations and eviscerations, and every known profanity.</text>
