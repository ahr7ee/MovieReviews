      <text> A faux documentary grounded in ethnicity and mired in absurdity, “Finishing the Game” is a terrific idea still waiting to be fashioned into a real movie.  When Bruce Lee died suddenly in 1973 at 32, he had filmed only 12 minutes of his dream project, “The Game of Death.” The studio’s decision to complete the film using a replacement actor outraged fans and provides the impetus for “Finishing the Game,” an extended audition sequence for the new Bruce Lee.  Marshaling the unlikeliest of candidates, the movie stabs ineffectually at Asian stereotypes and the ghettoization of Chinese-American actors. But the director, Justin Lin (who wrote the screenplay with Josh Diamond), lacks comic timing and the ability to hear jokes thud to the floor: a pornography setup with an irascible Ron Jeremy  feels even more tired than his trademark mustache.  Filled with chop-socky parody and too-tight jumpsuits, “Finishing the Game” saves its sharpest barbs for a sequence featuring the excellent Dustin Nguyen as a television cop saddled with the catch phrase “I ain’t gonna do your laundry.” Sadly his efforts (and those of a good-natured James Franco as his bemused partner), fall far short of rescuing a movie that, unlike its inspiration, never gets off the ground.</text>
