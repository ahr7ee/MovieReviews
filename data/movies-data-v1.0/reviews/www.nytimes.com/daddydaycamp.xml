      <text> This slapdash sequel to “Daddy Day Care” finds its hero, Charlie Hinton (Cuba Gooding Jr., replacing the original film’s star, Eddie Murphy), taking over Camp Driftwood, the ramshackle day camp he attended as a boy. He hopes to expand his business; bond with his overprotected son, Ben (Spencir Bridges); and avenge an ancient humiliation by his childhood nemesis, Lance Warner (Lochlyn Munro), a rich swine who attended a rival day camp and now owns it.  Aghast at Lance’s guerrilla-style hazing of Charlie’s charges and Camp Driftwood’s decay (the methane-leaking bathroom hut passes gas by itself), Charlie reaches out to his father, Col. Buck Hinton of the Marines (Richard Gant), a hard case who Charlie says specialized in “anger, shaming and criticism.”  Buck leads Charlie’s campers on forced marches and insurgent-style raids against Lance’s minions, and instills a stoic spirit that has been synonymous with heroism since Achilles was in diapers.  Of course the children adore Buck — particularly Ben, who craves a father figure who doesn’t shriek like an old lady. Mr. Gant’s charming characterization — Norman Schwarzkopf by way of Captain Kangaroo — is syrup poured atop a heaping helping of warrior-jock worship.  Like “The Pacifier” and “Transformers,” “Daddy Day Camp” (directed by Fred Savage of “Wonder Years” fame) is a recruiting poster for kids, insisting that there’s no domestic problem that military values can’t solve.  “Daddy Day Camp” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has slapstick violence, mild profanity and bathroom humor.</text>
