      <text> In Todd Holland’s “Firehouse Dog” a pampered Hollywood pooch trades his movie-star lifestyle for a run-down firehouse sadly in need of a mascot and some esprit de corps. It’s not long before the resourceful animal is counseling a motherless boy and his neglectful father, saving the firehouse from being closed and tracking down a serial arsonist. Whatever they were paying this mutt, it wasn’t enough.  When a 12-year-old, Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson), first encounters the bedraggled Dewey, a k a Rexxx — a stage name suggesting a rather more adult movie career — he’s unimpressed. But Shane is lonely; his father (Bruce Greenwood), a fire captain, is preoccupied with budget cuts and depressed by the recent death of his brother, and it’s easy for Dewey to capture the boy’s heart by defecating in his lunch and passing gas on his bed. Lifelong marriages have been based on less.  As Dewey works to resolve father-son issues and improve Shane’s grades, Mr. Holland and his cadre of writers fill the screen with generic supporting players and some satisfyingly gritty action sequences. Working with four interchangeable Deweys, the filmmakers create a sufficient number of lively stunts to keep the kiddies amused, though the film’s wittiest moment — a canine parody of Dudley Moore’s first glimpse of Bo Derek in “10” — will be appreciated only by their parents. In trying to straddle both age groups, however, “Firehouse Dog” proves decidedly less nimble than its furry star.  “Firehouse Dog” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has flames, flatulence and inoffensive four-letter words.</text>
