      <text> Between the 2002 documentary "Spellbound" and the recent screen adaptation of the novel "Bee Season," the spelling-bee film is fast becoming a genre unto itself. In this inner-city version,  11-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated African-American girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. But she refuses to participate in the school spelling bee until the principal (Curtis Armstrong) threatens her with detention. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's overworked single mother, Tanya (Angela Bassett), objects to her daughter's obsession with what she regards as a game. If Akeelah is to pursue her dream of going to the national bee in Washington, it will have to be behind her mother's back.  The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is in essence a formulaic sports picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. Ms. Bassett and Mr. Fishburne, who were electrifying as Tina and Ike Turner in the biopic "What's Love Got to Do With It?," have too few scenes together to develop a real rapport, but Mr. Fishburne and the young Ms. Palmer match wits with a satisfying crackle.  "Akeelah and the Bee" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some strong language, but has no sex or violence. It should be appropriate for most children.</text>
