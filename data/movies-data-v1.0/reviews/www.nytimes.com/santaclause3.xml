      <text> One of the good things about bad movies is that when someone sneers about the unworthiness of a perfectly mediocre film like, say, “Crash,” you can turn to a seriously unworthy film like, say, “The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause” and laugh. Ho. Ho. Ho. The third though probably not the last in the successful “Clause” franchise (the first two films raked in almost $300 million  in American theaters), this latest installment again stars Tim Allen as the Everyman turned Father Christmas. Since there’s little drama to be wrung from a character as clean as Claus, the story cooked up by Ed Decter and John J. Strauss turns on the kind of message that could fit on the inside of a store-bought greeting card, essentially: Families are special, and you are, too.  Christmas is about to pop and so, with her first baby, is Mrs. Claus (Elizabeth Mitchell). She’s sad. She misses her parents. Her parents visit her. They tend not to say or do much, but because they are played by the invaluable Alan Arkin and the equally welcome Ann-Margret, you don’t really mind. The in-laws  haven’t a clue that their daughter is married to Santa, so he pretends that the North Pole is Canada, which is mildly amusing  only because Mr. Arkin views the masquerading elves with vinegary skepticism. Even better is Martin Short, who snaps the otherwise dead proceedings (the director is Michael Lembeck) to life as the villainous Jack Frost. Mr. Short is the kind of Christmas ham everyone can enjoy.  The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause is rated G for general audiences. It’s squeaky clean, but you might die of boredom.</text>
