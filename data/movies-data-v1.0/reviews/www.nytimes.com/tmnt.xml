      <text> As Hollywood falls over itself to produce greener movies with ecologically correct themes, only the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remain willing to suggest that there is an upside to toxic waste. Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, these crime-fighting reptiles have been rechristened "TMNT" and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery  specialists. Nevertheless, the now-23-year-old gang  — perhaps to  connect better with its target audience — is still living at home.  Picking up where the third movie left off 14 years ago,  the story finds Michelangelo clowning at children's parties, Donatello manning a tech support hot line, Raphael playing nighttime vigilante and Leonardo skulking in the Central American jungle. But when a wealthy New York industrialist (snootily voiced by Patrick Stewart) begins collecting 3,000-year-old monsters (all 13 of which are likely to be coming soon to a Happy Meal near you), Leo must rejoin his brothers to avert the end of the world. Or something.  A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, "TMNT" offers an impressive lack of visual texture and discouraging human representation. (Maybe one day animators will learn that the female body requires space between the hips for more than just a bellybutton.) The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.  "TMNT" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has toothy monsters, scary female body images and ferociously ripped reptiles.</text>
