      <text> This film about a brilliant boy pianist fighting to shape his destiny was Switzerland’s entry for the 2006 Oscars, and you can see why. Like most award-seeking crowd-pleasers, it places uncomfortable impulses in opposition — in this case parents’ desire to develop a child’s latent genius, versus the child’s desire to have a “normal” childhood and find his own way — then dramatizes them in the most unchallenging way imaginable.  Vitus is a Franz Liszt in the making, and academically gifted to boot, but he would rather fly planes. His saintly grandfather (Bruno Ganz) respects his individuality, even as Vitus’s loving but self-centered parents (Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker) jump him ahead in school and make him perform at parties.  The title character is played as a  6-year-old by Fabrizio Borsani and as a 12-year-old by Teo Georghiu. Both performers are real piano prodigies, and the director, Fredi M. Murer, acknowledges their gifts in shots lingering on their finger-work.  Unfortunately, Mr. Murer is too sweet on his characters, including Vitus, a brat who sasses his teachers, scams his parents, creepily courts a teenage girl (Tamara Scarpellini) who was once his baby sitter and sneaks into a commuter airport and steals a plane for a joy ride. The triumphant musical cues and comic double takes encourage us to cheer Vitus’s high jinks as if he were Ferris Bueller’s ivory-tickling kid brother.  “Vitus” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has underage drinking, adult situations and mildly inappropriate language.</text>
