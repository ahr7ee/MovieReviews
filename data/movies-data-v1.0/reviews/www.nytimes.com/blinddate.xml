      <text> Don and Janna are a longtime couple — we know this from the narration of their unseen daughter — who periodically meet in a bar, pretending to be strangers. They take turns placing personal ads that lead to bouts of melancholy play-acting and occasional humor, as they explore alternative personalities and possibilities. They try out being younger, sexier, more ambitious, more carefree, and their encounters make up Stanley Tucci’s “Blind Date.”  Perhaps the most interesting thing about Don and Janna is that they are played by Mr. Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, two wonderful actors who tend to take smaller roles in bigger movies. They filmed “Blind Date” on a single set two years ago, and while it does not quite work as psychological inquiry or cogent drama, it is an interesting project. The film was based, loosely but loyally, on an earlier movie by Theo van Gogh, the Dutch filmmaker who was murdered by a Muslim extremist in 2004.  “Blind Date” is one of several American films to pay Mr. van Gogh the homage of a remake — the best known is Steve Buscemi’s “Interview,” a more fully realized work — but it’s hard not to conclude that something has been lost in the translation. The self-consciousness of the premise and the playlike structure of “Blind Date” clash with the naturalism of Mr. Tucci and Ms. Clarkson’s acting styles, and the film never lifts itself above its origin as a well-meaning, underdeveloped exercise.</text>
