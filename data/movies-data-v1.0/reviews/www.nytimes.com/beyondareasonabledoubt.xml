      <text> If we learn anything from “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,” a remake of Fritz Lang’s 1956 drama of the same name, it’s that flawed movies are rarely improved by car chases and the addition of Michael Douglas. Not that Mr. Douglas, playing a crooked Louisiana district attorney, can really be blamed for that faraway look in his eye: if you were burdened  with a coif so pampered it virtually demands its own dialogue, you’d be embarrassed too.  Compounding the awkwardness is Jesse Metcalfe’s performance as C. J., a rabid reporter who suspects the district attorney  of fabricating evidence.  Hoping to prove this — and  perhaps  win a Pulitzer — C. J., aided by a colleague (Joel David Moore), frames himself for the murder of a prostitute. One prosecution and one-too-many plot twists later, C. J. learns that pretty-boy looks and a penchant for unwieldy outbursts (“This is the diem we have to carpe!”) are no match for a supersmart girlfriend. (Even a thoroughly bored Amber Tamblyn is better than none at all.)  Capably directed by Peter Hyams (who removed the anti-death-penalty slant from Douglas Morrow’s 1956 screenplay), “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt” barrels along without fuss or emotional depth. Despite excellent stunt work and a too-brief appearance by Orlando Jones as an unflappable cop, the movie — unlike Mr. Douglas’s hairdo — never rises above mediocrity.  “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Unconvincing seduction and convincing vehicular shenanigans.</text>
