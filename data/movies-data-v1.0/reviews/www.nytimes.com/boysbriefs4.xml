      <text> “Boys Briefs 4” packages a half-dozen short yet interminable films about male prostitutes, with results of interest to precisely three demographics: programmers of gay film festivals, admirers of barely legal rough trade and connoisseurs of cliché. If you don’t belong to any of these categories but are dragged to the movie by someone who does, suggest staying home and renting “Boys Briefs 2” instead. You can tell them I said it’s the “Citizen Kane” of gay omnibus movies, and it will be much easier for you to pretend you are tired and leave.  We’re a long way from the hustler poetics of “My Own Private Idaho,” though we do pass through a hysterically stylized patch of rural New Zealand, courtesy of the director Welby Ings. His “Boy” turns Goth nonsense up to 11, burying a trite crime story under a mulch of 1990’s music video mannerisms. The Paris of “Gigolo,” directed by Bastian Schweitzer, is an improvement when its hilarious Euro-trash styling reminds us that the City of Light is also the city of petulant Algerian rent boys given to existential interior monologues.  In Armen Kazazian’s “Gold,” the client is a painter going blind. In the appropriately titled “Rock Bottom,” by Mary Feuer, he is a pathetic writer. Surprisingly, there is not one film about a mediocre filmmaker exploiting the talents of a needy youngster. Unfortunately, there are six.</text>
