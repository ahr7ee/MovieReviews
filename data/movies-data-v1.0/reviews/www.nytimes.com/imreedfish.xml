      <text> Sweetness and whimsy fill the screen to capacity in "I'm Reed Fish," a rural coming-of-age tale that's so laid-back that its cast is almost horizontal. Set in the fictional town of Mud Meadows — a cross between Stars Hollow and Lake Wobegon — this movie is about a guy who makes a movie about his life. Moreover, it was written by the real Mr. Fish, drawing from events in his own life. Try to stay with me now.  Our small-town hero (played by Jay Baruchel) is a gangly young man at that difficult stage between about-to-be-married and calling-it-off. Shuffling back and forth between his serene fiancée (Alexis Bledel) and a sunny singer-songwriter (Schuyler Fisk), Reed can barely concentrate on his daily radio show. Meanwhile his folksy listeners are irritated by his escalating distraction. Who will help them with their shrubbery regulations?  Filled with painfully awkward men with painfully bad haircuts, "I'm Reed Fish" is directed by Zackary Adler, exhibiting less energy than a sloth on Seconal. As the young man fearful of living an old man's life, Mr. Baruchel recalls John Turturro in his Barton Fink incarnation: all bones and aching eyes. Yet not even Mr. Fink would dither so gracelessly between the girl in the hand and the one he can't get out of his head.  "I'm Reed Fish" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild language and the bizarre offspring of a zebra and a horse.</text>
