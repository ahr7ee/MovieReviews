      <text> From a producer of “Crash” comes “Haven,” an even phonier exercise in manufactured conflict, facile irony and preposterous contrivance. The story begins with an American businessman (Bill Paxton) who, betrayed by a British financier (Stephen Dillane), flees to the Cayman Islands with his daughter (Agnes Bruckner). Enter Fritz (Victor Rasuk), a local delinquent, along with all manner of trouble (greed, racism, colonialism, acid flung in the face), not least of which is a violently arbitrary rupture in the plot.  “Haven” now turns its mind, so to speak, to Shy (Orlando Bloom), an introspective fisherman whose love for a local girl (Zoë Saldana) breeds trouble with her family (Anthony Mackie and Robert Wisdom). If by this point, the writer and director Frank E. Flowers has not convinced you of his subtle genius, note that Shy mans a boat named Destiny.  Eventually the plot strands twist together and the movie goes completely berserk, looping back and forth through time and space in a flailing attempt at nonlinear poetic frisson. Achieving instead only convoluted nonsense, Mr. Flowers stirs up a combustible blend of social ills and sub-Shakespearean passions, doses it with overburdened metaphor and stands back as it blows up in his face.  “Haven” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex, drugs, cursing and violence.</text>
