      <text>reputable filmmaker courting a rendezvous with Satan might do well to keep a stash of pea soup on hand to toss in viewers' faces should they start nodding out. A splash or two would have added some pungency to "Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist," Paul Schrader's tastefully gloomy, sometimes plodding and occasionally impenetrable prologue to the 1973 horror blockbuster. But those dribbles, had he allowed them, would have sabotaged the director's perversely high-minded goal of enshrining the remnants of a tacky horror franchise by treating them as sacred relics in a serious metaphysical investigation. "Dominion" includes some terrible events, the worst being the discovery of a classroom of slaughtered African children, but the gratuitous gore is minimal. "Dominion" offers no visceral shocks to approach the projectile vomiting of green gunk or the 360-degree head spinning in the original "Exorcist," directed by William Friedkin. You will not hear a demonically possessed child spit potty-mouthed expletives in the gravelly voice of Beelzebub, Mercedes McCambridge or anybody else. Satan, when finally encountered, is an androgynous levitating Buddha-like figure, by turns seductive and ominous. Morgan Creek, the company that produced Mr. Schrader's ambitious, brooding hybrid of semi-horror and semi-art, rejected it and hired a flashy hack, Renny Harlin, to reshoot the movie with a mandate to reinstate the grotesque equivalents of spewed pea soup (here, a maggot-covered newborn baby and a pack of ravenous hyenas tearing a man apart), along with growled profanity. In pop music terms, Mr. Harlin's movie, released last summer, might be described as a crude heavy-metal demolition of Mr. Schrader's sensitive singer-songwriter album. Both films star Stellan Skarsgard as Father Lankester Merrin, the Dutch parish priest turned archaeologist who loses his faith after being forced by Nazi soldiers to carry out an atrocity in 1944. The movies' contradictory intentions are illustrated by their handling of this material. In Mr. Schrader's film, everything follows from this event, which begins the movie. Mr. Harlin's movie, "Exorcist: The Beginning," carelessly shoehorns an abbreviated flashback of the same atrocity late into the film as an explanatory afterthought. It would be nice to report that Mr. Schrader's Nazi sequence in which Father Merrin faces a predicament reminiscent of "Sophie's Choice" has the weight of Alan J. Pakula's 1982 film, or of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List."  But it comes off as shrill, tinny melodrama. The story then leaps ahead three years to find the former priest working as an archaeologist in the Turkana district of British East Africa (present-day Kenya). To his astonishment he discovers a fifth-century Christian Byzantine church in almost perfect condition, buried beneath the sand. As the story develops, we learn that this church when originally excavated was found to be a source of evil and immediately reinterred. Besides the superstitious, volatile Turkana tribe, the clashing members of the desert community include Father Francis (Gabriel Mann), a devout young Catholic priest dispatched to monitor the dig; Major Granville (Julian Wadham), a cynical, hard-nosed British officer and racist who blames all the upheaval on the Turkanas; and Dr. Rachel Lesno (Clara Bellar), a humane concentration-camp survivor who operates a clinic. But the most compelling local is Cheche (the pop star Billy Crawford), a severely crippled teenager and cowering pariah, who, tended by Rachel, is miraculously healed only to find his body becoming a furious battleground between good and evil. Mr. Schrader bets all his philosophic chips on this ambiguous, fascinating figure. Where Father Merrin in Mr. Harlin's movie was a dour adventurer embarked on a desert safari, here he is all grim metaphysical business, glowering in the grip of a spiritual crisis whose resolution will carry him a quarter-century hence to Georgetown (in the person of Max von Sydow) as a formidable ghost buster. How seriously does Mr. Schrader take all this mumbo jumbo? His throwing in of an eerie dream sequence that pays direct homage to Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" suggests his personal artistic investment was considerable. But there's no escaping  that "Dominion" is finally an act of commercial scavenging. You may retrieve the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from your trash and assemble them into a cute, novelty gift basket. But if you bend down and take a whiff, your nose is still met with the scent of garbage. As any chef will tell you, it's the ingredients, stupid! Mud cannot be turned into a chocolate soufflï¿½, nor can "The Exorcist," in its many incarnations, be transformed into anything beyond a lurid supernatural shocker. "Dominion Prequel to the Exorcist" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence.</text>
