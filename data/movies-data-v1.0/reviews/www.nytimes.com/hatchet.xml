      <text> Opening like a Mardi Gras edition of “Girls Gone Wild” and closing with a reverent nod to “Friday the 13th,” “Hatchet,” a Bayou-based homage to the slasher giants of yesteryear, is more concerned with touchstones than with terror. The movie may proudly  assemble its bodily fluids the old-fashioned way — that is, with  care and K-Y jelly — but absent any tension, it’s all just so much splatter.  Stranded in the middle of a supposedly haunted swamp, a boatload of the usual mismatched tourists — including a pretend pornographer and his aspiring starlets — is gradually and creatively dismembered. Their assailant is one Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder), a typically sad monster whose misshapen appearance and facility with power tools  suggest a genetic collision between the Elephant Man and the home design guru Ty Pennington. As played by Mr. Hodder — an actor with Jason Voorhees under his belt and the useful ability to vomit on command — Victor easily steals the show.  Affectionately written and directed by Adam Green, “Hatchet”  refers to everything from “Dawson’s Creek” to the “Candyman” films (whose star, the wonderful Tony Todd, has a lively cameo) while raising more giggles than goosebumps. Horror without suspense is like sex without love: you can appreciate the technicalities,  but ultimately there’s no reason to care.  “Hatchet” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are impaled, disemboweled and  beheaded by a psycho, as well as repeatedly terrorized by half-naked women.</text>
