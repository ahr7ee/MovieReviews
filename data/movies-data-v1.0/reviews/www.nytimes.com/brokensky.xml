      <text> The plot of “Broken Sky” goes like this: Boy (Miguel Angel Hoppe) meets boy (Fernando Arroyo), boys fall in love, boys have lots of sex. Boy No. 1 cruises another boy (Ignacio Pereda) at a nightclub; the boys’ relationship is strained. Enter a new boy (Alejandro Rojo), and a new falling in love, and lots more sex. Tension and sex and more sex ensue, until the original pair eventually come to reconciliation. The end. No detail has been omitted from this synopsis of the narrative, which unfolds over the course of nearly two and a half hours of audacious erotic minimalism.  The idea of “Broken Sky,” which was written and directed by Julián Hernández, is far more complex: to flesh out from this skeletal premise a voluptuous epic of nonverbal phenomena, to evoke the tone and texture of a kiss, a glance, the pulse of desire, the color of jealousy, the pattern of cracks in a broken heart. Dialogue is minimal; image says all. With the help of Alejandro Cantu, his gutsy, hypersensitive cinematographer, Mr. Hernández circles and scrutinizes his actors, maneuvering them in and out of elaborate traveling shots that dissolve continuous space. Style makes meaning, and the style is extravagantly abstract.  Movies, and our expectations of them, remain so much in thrall to outmoded conventions of the novel and theater that “Broken Sky” may seem flagrantly precious. It is no more contrived than Keats. Mr. Hernández doesn’t always grab what he’s reaching for — his talent soars untethered by discipline — but the thrust of his effort lights up the sky.</text>
