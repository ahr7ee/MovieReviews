      <text> If we are to believe "Sorry, Haters," the worst threat facing the United States today is not Islamic extremists but lonely young women with low self-esteem. While this may not be news to a generation raised on "Oprah," the movie pushes its thesis so far beyond the bounds of sanity that you have to wonder if the director, Jeff Stanzler, is entirely serious.  Shamelessly drawing on post-Sept. 11 anxieties, the movie follows a New York City cab driver named Ashade (the Tunisian actor and director Abdellatif Kechiche), a Syrian Muslim whose brother is imprisoned at Guant√°namo. When he's flagged down by Phoebe (Robin Wright Penn), who appears to be stalking her former husband and his new wife, Ashade is willing to overlook her mildly eccentric behavior and accepts her offer of legal help for his brother. But when Ashade's sister-in-law is suddenly arrested by the police, he discovers that Phoebe's erratic personality is more dangerous than he could ever have imagined.  Despite the impressive commitment of the two leads, whose barbed interaction lends a dark magic to the film's early scenes, "Sorry, Haters" unfolds with such utter looniness that the horrible final moments are more likely to inspire laughter than shock. Casually insulting our emotions and intelligence, Mr. Stanzler seems to have shaped his film with one goal in mind: to prove that audacity and recklessness are acceptable substitutes for craft and common sense. Needless to say, they're not.</text>
