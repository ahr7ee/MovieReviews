      <text> A bad movie with a good heart, “Music Within” is a biography  of Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston), a debating champion who suffered severe hearing damage   in Vietnam, then reinvented himself as an activist for the handicapped.  Mr. Livingston sells this war hero’s patience, work ethic and independent spirit. But he fails to illuminate Mr. Pimentel’s anger and melancholy, qualities that the film credits with spurring his alcoholism, destroying his marriage to a hippie-swinger-turned-domestic-martyr named Christine (Melissa George) and fueling his greatest accomplishments (including the writing of  a California State guideline for dealing with  disabled  job applicants, and agitating on behalf of the Americans With Disabilities Act).  The film’s sound design inventively suggests how its hero hears the world, and Mr. Pimentel’s relationships with his best friends — Art Honneyman (Michael Sheen), a puckish man with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair, and Mike Stolz (Yul Vázquez), a hot-tempered, profanely funny fellow vet  — feel lived-in and real.  But the film’s direction, by Steven Sawalich, and its screenplay, credited to Bret McKinney, Mark Andrew Olsen and Kelly Kennemer, are annoyingly unimaginative. When the screen fills with shots of soldiers in helicopters scored to “We’ve Got to Get Out of This Place,” you may be inclined to agree.  “Music Within” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language including sexual references, and some drug content.</text>
