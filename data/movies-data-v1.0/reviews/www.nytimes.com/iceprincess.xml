      <text>s the figure-skating movie "Ice Princess" executes lazy triple loops on its way to its climactic but underwhelming competition, you can feel this niche-marketed tweener fantasy of athletic glory frantically trying to balance a decent sense of values against a market-savvy awareness. The movie's likable saucer-eyed heroine, Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), is a high school physics whiz on the fast track to a Harvard scholarship. When she is drawn into the world of competitive figure skating, she has to make a Hollywood choice between equations and eye shadow.

Once she calms them down, she begins taking skating classes in which she demonstrates prodigious talent, and her progress whets her appetite for competition. Mother wrinkles her nose in disapproval. The rink's owner, Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall), is a hard-boiled former skating champion who blew her chance for Olympic glory years earlier. She is now a coach ruthlessly pushing her daughter Gen (Hayden Penettiere) to succeed where she failed.

Casey's prodigious talents seem less than phenomenal compared with theirs, and when audiences go crazy for her, their enthusiasm seems misplaced. "Ice Princess" is on the side of youth. The two pushy mothers are forced to let go and allow their daughters to be who they are. In addition to possible medals, a reward held out is the devotion of a moist, cow-eyed boyfriend (Trevor Blumas), who suggests a Robbie Benson-manquï¿½.</text>
