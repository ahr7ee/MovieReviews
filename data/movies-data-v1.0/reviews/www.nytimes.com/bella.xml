      <text> It is not hard to see why “Bella,” a saccharine trifle directed by Alejandro Monteverde, won the People’s Choice Award at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. This is a movie that wears its bleeding heart on its sleeve and loves its characters to distraction. Nothing — not even significant plot glitches and inconsistencies — is allowed to get in the way of its bear-hugging embrace of sweetness and light.  The protagonist, José (the Mexican actor Eduardo Verástegui), is a selfless angel with big blue eyes and a gaping emotional wound who works as a chef in his brother Manny’s Mexican restaurant in New York City. When Manny fires Nina (Tammy Blanchard), a waitress, for being late, José quits in solidarity and becomes her rescuer. After she confesses that she is pregnant and planning an abortion, he decides  to talk her out of it, helps her find a new job and takes her home to his warm-hearted Latino family on Long Island.  Although José is an unattached dreamboat, there isn’t the slightest suggestion of romance between him and Nina. All we know of José is that a tragic accident several years earlier derailed his brilliant soccer career just as he was about to sign a $2 million contract. When the incident is finally shown (at the movie’s halfway point), it is milked for every last teardrop, and José’s good deeds can be seen as acts of atonement.  If “Bella” (the title doesn’t make sense until the last scene) is a mediocre cup of mush, the response to it suggests how desperate some people are for an urban fairy tale with a happy ending, no matter how ludicrous.  “Bella” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for thematic elements and brief disturbing images.</text>
