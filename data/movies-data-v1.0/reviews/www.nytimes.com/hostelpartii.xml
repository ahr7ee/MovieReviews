      <text> Benefiting from a higher budget, Eli Roth’s follow-up to his generally odious “Hostel” may sport glossier production values, but its driving motivation — to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness — remains just as low.  Wasting less time than its predecessor, “Hostel: Part II” plunges right in, with the predictably hasty disposal of Paxton (Jay Hernandez), the first movie’s sole survivor, before shifting focus to a trio of American female students (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo and Bijou Phillips), who are only fractionally more tolerable than the moronic frat boys of Part 1.  Lured to Slovakia with the promise of a first-class spa experience, the girls instead become the prisoners of the rich and twisted who electronically bid big bucks — call it eSlay — to brutalize and butcher kidnapped young tourists. The inner workings of this torture factory and its clients, whose ultra-secrecy generated the little suspense found in the original, are now freely revealed.  Mr. Roth, part of a new breed of horror directors affectionately labeled the “Splat Pack,” is regarded by some as a savior of the genre, though it could be argued that he is more effectively a saboteur. He might have mastered the cheap sadism-as-entertainment gross-out, but he has yet to produce a single genuine, old-fashioned fright.  Rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for explicit torture, carnage, nudity, sexual content, language and general nastiness.</text>
