      <text> Correction Appended  “Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts,” Paul Simon once sang, and in 2008 there’s Miley Cyrus (excuse me, Miley Ray Cyrus)  — on television, on the iTunes Top 10 and in theaters with this 3-D artifact of her just concluded tour. Bygone decades had Donny Osmond, Menudo and New Kids on the Block. Today Walt Disney — which also spawned Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera — feeds tweens their pop idols. But don’t call it packaged teenage rebellion. In this movie  there are few teenagers and no rebellion, only bouncy inspirational ditties. “I Miss You,” a wholesome ode to Ms. Cyrus’s dead grandfather, is as doleful as it gets.  What you do see are diverting 3-D effects and lots of playing to the camera by Ms. Cyrus, who performs as both herself and as her television alter ego, Hannah Montana. To her credit her attire isn’t tawdry, and it appears that she can sing.  What you also see is Kenny Ortega (the mastermind behind “High School Musical”), this year’s Lou Pearlman, reassuring Ms. Cyrus after she has been literally dropped onstage by her dancers. Taking orders from adults can’t be fun for a 15-year-old on a grinding three-month concert-go-round.  Not that you’ll learn that here, or much about Ms. Cyrus. Does it matter? Not to your “Hannah Montana”-addicted daughter. She’ll be listening to other music soon enough. Maybe Ms. Cyrus will be making it. Maybe.</text>
