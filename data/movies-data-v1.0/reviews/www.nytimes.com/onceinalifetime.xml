      <text> Giddy, gossipy and endearingly unslick, "Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos" chronicles the  rise and fall of the most famous   soccer team in the United States with slapdash glee. Fielding heroes and villains, gentlemen and rogues, booze and women, it plays like the "Dynasty" of sports documentaries. There's even a little soccer.  Via newsreels and interviews (both winking and candid) we watch a ragtag team of part-time players move from a scrubby field that had to be spray-painted green before games to a 1977 North American Soccer League championship playoff in Giants Stadium in front of 77,691 fans. "I don't think any one of us ever felt entitled," says Shep Messing, a former player whose glorious sideburns and moody gaze once landed him a nude magazine spread. The moment is surprisingly moving, a micro-view of the film's perfect balance of heart and hedonism.  Crucial  to the team's success was the recruitment of an international roster of stars, led by the exuberant Pel√© (coaxed out of retirement with the help of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and untold millions) and Germany's smooth-as-silk Franz Beckenbauer. But the movie's central intrigue is the relationship between the team's millionaire founder, the Warner Communications chairman Steve Ross, and the volatile Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia. "He was a malign influence," Clive Toye, the Cosmos' former general manager, says of Mr. Chinaglia, who smirks delightedly at the camera like an extra from "The Godfather." But this is a movie so unabashedly in love with its subject that  even audiences who don't know Giorgio Chinaglia from  Georgie Best will leave the theater grinning.  "Once in a Lifetime" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some strong language and cheesy male nudity.</text>
