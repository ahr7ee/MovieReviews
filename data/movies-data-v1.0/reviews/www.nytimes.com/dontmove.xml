      <text>he brilliant Italian actor Sergio Castellitto is especially good at playing highly civilized men who struggle to control, or at least to comprehend, their own savagery. In Marco Bellocchio's "My Mother's Smile," which opened in New York a few weeks ago, he was a literature professor tormented by lust, family history and rebellious urges left over from his youth. As a theater director and actor in Jacques Rivette's "Va Savoir" (2001), he was not so much tormented as exasperated, but it was his impatience and volatility - a characteristic blend of intellectual quickness and reckless physical potency - that gave that otherwise polite comedy of manners a vivifying jolt of rudeness. In "Don't Move," which he also directed, Mr. Castellitto plays Timoteo, a highly successful Rome surgeon who lives surrounded by the trappings of upper-middle-class comfort: a Volvo, a beach house, a nice apartment, a lovely wife and a daughter. While it is hardly surprising that Timoteo is unhappy - if he were not, there wouldn't be much of a movie - Mr. Castellitto gives his bourgeois melancholy an almost operatic intensity. This is a man clearly burdened by an excess of feeling - sexual need, grief, guilt, longing, frustration - and even in moments of contentment or repose his face and posture betray his suffering. Unfortunately for those around him - and to some extent, for the audience - what Timoteo suffers from most is self-pity. This is not altogether clear at first, since when we first meet him he is confronting a genuinely cataclysmic event. His teenage daughter, Angela (Elena Perino), has been in a serious, possibly fatal motorbike accident, and she has been brought to the hospital where her father works. While he waits for news of her condition - and tries to get in touch with his wife, Elsa (Claudia Gerini), who is on a business trip to London - Timoteo reflects back on a period in his own life, right before Elsa became pregnant with Angela. "Don't Move," which closely follows the novel of the same title by Margaret Mazzantini (Mr. Castellitto's co-screenwriter, and also his wife), is a series of extended flashbacks, most of them chronicling an affair between Timoteo and a woman named Italia, played here by Penï¿½lope Cruz. The novel is Timoteo's first-person account of that ill-starred relationship, told to Angela as she lies in a coma, and the film hews closely to his point of view, which is both self-lacerating and self-serving. When Timoteo met Italia, a poor, unattractive woman from a rural village, she was living on the outskirts of Rome in a shabby house next to a half-built concrete apartment complex (he borrowed her phone when his car broke down), and it was perhaps the contrast between her mean circumstances and his own well-cushioned life that attracted him to her. In any case, their relationship begins with rape, and though it subsequently evolves into something consensual and even tender, there is no avoiding the ugly truth that Timoteo destroys her life to satisfy his own inchoate yearnings. Or so it would seem. But "Don't Move" is in some ways as evasive and self-serving as its main character, parading his flaws before us in order to obtain a forgiveness that he does not deserve. After the initial assault, he feels bad enough to write a confession in the sand, but he keeps returning to Italia, leading her on with unlikely promises. That he may intend to keep them only makes his weakness more glaring and allows the film to present his cruel, predatory behavior as passionate, even generous. This is the kind of movie - once a staple of European cinema - that detaches erotic desire from psychology or morals, but it lacks the sense of urgency and provocation that still pulse through, for example, Bernardo Bertolucci's "Last Tango in Paris." Like their protagonist, Mr. Castellitto and Ms. Mazzantini want to have it both ways: to plumb the depths of masculine obsession while retaining the unconditional sympathy that a potentially bereaved father deserves. The key to this trick - which almost works - is not so much Timoteo as Italia, an archetype of female masochism who raises abjection to the level of saintliness. Ms. Cruz, in her most credible performance to date - the first I have seen in any language that suggests she may be a real actress - is like a stick-figure Anna Magnani, feeding on her own capacity for selflessness. She willingly sacrifices her dignity, her body and whatever future she may have had. In return, she receives some of a mistress's traditional perquisites - a pair of shoes, a few thousand lire on the kitchen table, a few nights in a nice hotel - which become, in Timoteo's memory, the sacraments of a great, doomed love. "Don't Move" treats this sad, tawdry story like a thing of rare and delicate beauty, and it is a beautifully made film - decorously composed, meticulously acted, cleanly photographed. But all of these qualities make it seem complacent and hypocritical when it wants to be honest and brave, and sentimental rather than emotionally daring.</text>
