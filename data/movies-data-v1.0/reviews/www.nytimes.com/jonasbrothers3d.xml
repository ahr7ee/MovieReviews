      <text> “Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience” isn’t a movie so much as a devotional object, a kind of secular fetish designed to induce rapture. Submitting to the experience requires initiation into the teenybopper cult of the Jonas brothers trinity —  Joe, Kevin and Nick —  purveyors of innocuous, repetitive guitar pop and the kind of bland sexuality that provokes a certain type of teenage girl to wait 72 hours in the rain in Times Square for a chance to glimpse the godhead.  Directed with slick banality by Bruce Hendricks, “Jonas Brothers” consists of concert footage from a 2008 Madison Square Garden spectacular supplemented by ridiculous behind-the-scenes tidbits: the brothers pull up to a Virgin Megastore for the midnight release of their new album, fend off a throng of screaming fans, purchase three copies, then pile back into the limo and drive away.  The default camera position places the viewer in a sea of teenage fists clutching glow sticks, cameras or cellphones. Guitar picks are repeatedly — three dimensionally! — chucked at the screen. If you’ve ever wanted to crawl into Kevin’s chest hair, this is as close as you’re likely to get without incurring a restraining order.</text>
