      <text> There’s a riveting story lurking inside “Holly,” a documentary-fiction hybrid about sex trafficking in Cambodia. It’s just not the one the filmmakers want to tell.  One of three films of the K11 Project (named for Phnom Penh’s red-light district and designed to raise awareness of child prostitution), “Holly” continually douses its drama with the cold water of education. In Patrick (Ron Livingston), a numb American expat and smuggler, the film has a fascinating protagonist: a man without country or comfort. Yet when he becomes improbably obsessed with rescuing a 12-year-old Vietnamese virgin (Thuy Nguyen) from the clutches of traffickers, what could have been a gripping study of emotional resurrection devolves into a blurred odyssey of white guilt.  Shot on location in the brothels and alleys of Phnom Penh, “Holly” has a grubby authenticity that fails to compensate for slack plotting and a monotonous tone. Udo Kier is dependably sleazy in the thankless role of an unrepentant pedophile, while the great Virginie Ledoyen is wasted as a human-rights worker whose only task is to remind us of the facts and figures of the under-age sex trade.  Countering the clumsy cross-pollination of drama and philanthropy, Mr. Livingston performs with increasing intensity and motivational ambivalence. In his hands Patrick is an irretrievably lost soul, as confused by his savior impulse as its beneficiary is.    “Holly” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is on-camera solicitation and off-camera acceptance.</text>
