      <text> In “Mr. Woodcock,” a self-help author named John Farley (Seann William Scott) returns to his Nebraska hometown and learns that his long-widowed mother, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), is dating the title character, a coach who made John’s life hell.  Woodcock, played with icy panache by Billy Bob Thornton, is a smirking bully who turns gym class into boot camp, flaunts his intimacy with John’s mom and talks in hard-boiled aphorisms. (“I’m already past my past. That’s why I call it my past.”) Horrified, John tries to break up the affair, leading to wacky misunderstandings and much hugging and learning.  Between Mr. Thornton’s wry performance and Tami Reiker’s nuanced wide-screen photography, you half-expect “Woodcock” to deliver more than formulaic laughs. When John meets Woodcock’s dad (Bill Macy) — a hateful coot who barks “Water sports is for girls and sodomites!” — the film threatens to show that Woodcock is not just an emblem of the jock bully mentality, but also one of its damaged products.  But such an approach would complicate John’s hatred of Woodcock, and the film’s screenwriters, Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert, and its director, Craig Gillespie, won’t have it. They instead endorse the idea that Woodcock’s abuse made John a better, stronger person. It’s “The Great Santini” remade as a sitcom.  “Mr. Woodcock” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for crude and sexual content, thematic material, language and a mild drug reference.
