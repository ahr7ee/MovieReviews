      <text>In Swaziland, one of Africa’s smallest countries and its sole remaining absolute monarchy, the prevalence of AIDS and starvation ensures an average life expectancy of 31 years. But “Without the King,” Michael Skolnik’s subtly perceptive documentary, avoids a tone of first-world outrage; leaning more toward understanding than blame, the film examines a country forced to choose between tradition and survival. Scenes of the current ruler, King Mswati III, and his extravagant lifestyle — multiple residences, limousines, a private jet — alternate with images of life in the townships, where clusters of rickety shacks surround filthy watering holes, and dinner might be intestines pilfered from the local dump. With near-absolute power (there is a constitution, but opposition parties are banned), the king maintains an offshore bank account worth billions of dollars and chooses a 13th wife at the annual dance of topless virgins. In Swaziland it’s very good to be the king. Or perhaps not. As expected, there are mutterings against the royal family and hints of civil war. Yet the film, fluidly shot by James Adolphus, remains deeply sensitive to the complexities of a culture whose attachment to monarchy contravenes its best interests. This dilemma is gradually becoming clear to Princess Sikhanyiso, the oldest of the king’s 22 children and a student in California. Intelligent, articulate, caring and strong-willed, she could be her country’s best hope.</text>
