      <text> When the veteran filmmaker Yoji Yamada makes a samurai movie, his warriors don't fly through the air on invisible wires or confront multiple foes while dancing from one tree to another. They have too many burdens — poverty, conscience, obedience to their clan — and the struggles of daily life leave little time for frivolous swordplay. So when violence does occur, it's solidly earthbound and staged with magnificent solemnity.  Mr. Yamada wants us to feel the moral weight of taking a life.  Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, "The Hidden Blade" focuses on Katagiri (Masatoshi Nagase), a gentle samurai troubled by his forbidden love for a low-caste servant girl (Takako Matsu) and confused by his clan's transition from swords to Western artillery. When an old friend is arrested for plotting against the Shogunate, Katagiri is ordered to kill him; but the assignment forces our shabby hero to follow his conscience, confront his corrupt clan lord and ultimately question the rules he lives and loves by.  Though less powerful than Mr. Yamada's "Twilight Samurai" (2002), "The Hidden Blade" is an affecting portrait of the impact of profound change on people with limited options. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, where necessities like food and medicine eclipse battles and bravery, Mr. Yamada is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life.  "The Hidden Blade" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).There's a hint of sex, some ponderous swordplay and a single, effective bullet.  The Hidden Blade </text>
