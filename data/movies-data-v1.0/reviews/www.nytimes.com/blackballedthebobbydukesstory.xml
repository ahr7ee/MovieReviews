      <text>This spoof of sports biopics stars Rob Corddry, best known as a correspondent for Comedy Central's "Daily Show With Jon Stewart." In "Blackballed," Mr. Corddry plays Bobby Dukes, a paintball legend who goes missing after a scandalous "wiping" incident (sprayed with paint by the opposing team, he wipes off the evidence and continues playing, to the shock of the entire paintball community.) Ten years later, Bobby resurfaces to prove himself in the Hudson Valley Paintball Classic. But will he be able to live down his disgrace in the eyes of his fellow paintballers, including Lenny Pear (Paul Scheer), the referee who caught him cheating all those years ago? Hastily shot on digital video, "Blackballed" is essentially an extended improvisational skit, with a troupe of comics riffing on a central joke (the elevation of paintball to a noble calling). Many cast members, including Mr. Corddry, are veterans of the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy team. The story is told in faux-documentary style, echoing the films of Christopher Guest, and if the cast never quite matches Mr. Guest's ensemble in comic inventiveness, they nonetheless manage to invest a very slight story line with a loose, scruffy charm.</text>
