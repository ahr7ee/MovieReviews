      <text> It's a cinematic well that never runs dry: postcollegiate 20-somethings reuniting for a group wallow in past glories and present resentments. In the aptly named "Standing Still" — a film with the dramatic momentum of a daisy-picking toddler — the excuse for the get-together is the Los Angeles wedding of Elise (Amy Adams) and Michael (Adam Garcia), a bland couple whose friends appear to have crossed over from an alternate universe. There's a cowboy-hatted movie star (James Van Der Beek), a blathering agent (Colin Hanks) and a lonely pack rat (Jon Abrahams) who uses prostitutes as a way of avoiding emotional involvement. This group has so little in common that it makes "St. Elmo's Fire" look like a miracle of complementary casting.  While the guys dodge commitment, self-awareness and adulthood in general, the women roll their eyes and wait to be needed. A refreshing exception is Jennifer (Lauren German), a London lesbian with ties to the bride-to-be and a delightfully insolent manner: when she approaches, the men scatter like blobs of mercury. But she's the only spark in yet another movie dedicated to privileged self-involvement; just once, it would be nice to observe the early-adulthood traumas of, say, some plumbers or pipe fitters. Surely they have friends, too.  "Standing Still" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some pot, some strippers, some girl-on-girl action.</text>
