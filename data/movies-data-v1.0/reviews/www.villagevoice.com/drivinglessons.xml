      <text>Helping out scary or crazy-looking old people as a means to come into one's own as an adult is a time-honored literary and cinematic conceit. In this case it's also semi-autobiographical, as writer-director Jeremy Brock  worked for Dame Peggy Ashcroft  as a lad. Rupert Grint , capably different here from his Harry Potter   persona, plays Ben, the vicar's son, pressured by his understated yet overbearing mother (Laura Linney , doing valiant battle with an English accent) to get a job. Circling the first appealing ad in the newspaper, Ben finds himself housekeeper and assistant to Evie Walton  (Julie Walters ), a loud, mercurial former grand dame of the stage who is mainly remembered for her stint on an '80s daytime soap. Initially, she's too much of a character for Ben to handle, but you just know that by the end of the day they will Learn Important Lessons from one another. The sentiment's a bit thick sometimes, but Walters remains sharp, and is sure to inspire drag queens everywhere.
