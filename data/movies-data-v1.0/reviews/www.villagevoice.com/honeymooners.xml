      <text>THE GREAT WATER    Directed by Ivo Trajkov    Picture This!, opens June 17, Quad
Orphans and cinema are old friends, at least since the days of D.W. Griffith  and Lillian Gish . Macedonian director Ivo Trajkov 's The Great Water  opens with an elderly politician, Lem Nikodinoski , being rushed to the hospital, as his mind wanders back to the close of World War II. Yugoslavia 's romance with Stalin was in full bloom, and the 12-year-old Lem (Saso Kekenovski) was interned in a re-education camp for the orphaned children of "enemies of the people." There he meets Isak (Maja Stankovska ), a boy who dabbles in occult religious practices and challenges the camp authorities. Despite the choppy script and cartoonishly bad villains, what emerges is a compelling tale of the moral compromises a corrupt system demands of even its most unwilling participants.
