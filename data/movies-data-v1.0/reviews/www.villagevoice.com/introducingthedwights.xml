      <text>Brenda Blethyn 's trademark histrionics&#151;maternal blubbering and drama-queen shrillness&#151;worked smashingly for her intentionally trying role in Secrets &amp; Lies , but her central performance in Introducing the Dwights  sees these traits amped to a rather squirmy 11. Misleadingly (if more interestingly) titled Clubland  when it screened at this year's Sundance, director Cherie Nowlan 's patchy Australian dramedy stars Blethyn as divorc√©e Jean, a once-famous bawdy comedienne who can't accept that she's past her prime. Oblivious to how her egomaniacal control issues are cock-blocking both of her sons, Jean is primarily stressing out strapping, 20-year-old mama's boy Tim (Khan Chittenden ), whose fear of losing his virginity to insecure but totally horny Jill (Emma Booth ) takes an unintentionally Oedipal bent whenever he runs home to support his mother's Benny Hill &#150;esque act instead. Other son Mark (Richard Wilson ) is slightly brain-damaged and dubiously written as the idiot-savant butt of many a gentle joke, which might have worked had the actor been more convincing (his girlfriend is played by a mentally retarded actress; why wasn't he?). With its broad, toothless humor and ham-fisted fits of melodrama, this sitcom-grade embarrassment aims to dethrone Muriel's Wedding  as the quirky Aussie feel-gooder of all time, except it hurts too much to watch.
