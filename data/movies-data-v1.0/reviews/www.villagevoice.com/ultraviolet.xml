      <text>Seems this is yet another puddle of futuristic sludge for us to blame on John Cassavetes , whose Gloria  (1980) reportedly inspired writer-director Kurt Wimmer  (Equilibrium ) to replace Gena Rowlands  with Milla Jovovich  and the original heroine's ordinary pistol with a Tec-9/knife combo that looks like an industrial-strength stapler. Another striking modification: Wimmer's late-21st-century Gloria is, in her words, "something less than human"&#151;a diseased vampire, in fact, who carries a real boy in her nth-generation iBook  even though there's a Blood War being waged between humans and her kind in what's left of Shanghai . Because the movie's smeared pastel images strongly suggest an untweaked blowup from the Xbox , it's never clear whether the rail-thin Jovovich actually performed in the film or just consented to full-body digitization. And though terms such as "dimension-compressing" and "vampiral antigens" are ostensibly meant to clarify things, the most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3,000 theaters.
