      <text>The scariest thing about Hellbent  is that somebody thought making this humorless gaysploitation slasher flick would be a good idea. A buff serial killer in a devil mask stalks an interchangeable cast of vapid cuties as they cruise the West Hollywood  Halloween carnival, offering the brain-dead twinks free makeovers as headless bodies. (It's hard to tell the difference.) I've seen spookier reruns of Paul Lynde  as center square. The gay cable channel Here, which commissioned this wretched filler, must really be hurting for "original" programming. Thanks, guys, but I'd rather watch infomercials.
