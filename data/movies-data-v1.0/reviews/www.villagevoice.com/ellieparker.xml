      <text>Mere months before her breakout role as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn in Mulholland Drive , Naomi Watts  played another L.A. actress in fellow MD  alum Scott Coffey 's short Ellie Parker , which premiered at Sundance in January 2001. In the four years since, EP  grew to a 95-minute feature&#151;and Watts's career blew up.
A clumsy spoof of Hollywood , EP  always roots for its hapless heroine. But where this trifle fascinates most is in its connections to David Lynch 's masterpiece. With the sunny, can-do attitude of Betty Elms , Ellie dons a lavender hoopskirt to impress the dissolute Russian producers during her callback for a risible Civil War pic. And like abject Diane Selwyn , Ellie is sexually betrayed, catching her boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino , who played the hit man Diane hires to kill Camilla Rhodes  in MD ) in bed with a low-level casting assistant (Jennifer Syme , who died in a car crash and to whom Lynch dedicates MD ).
But the hyperlinks don't end there. In a fleeting shot, Ellie walks past a movie theater with Play It As It Lays &#151;yet another Hollywood-set nightmare&#151;on the marquee. Maria Wyeth, the heroine of Joan Didion 's eviscerating novel, has a guest spot on a TV dud called Interstate 80 ; Ellie's audition tape features a clip from the daytime soap The Tides of Passion . Ellie, like Maria, lives in her car, shuttling from audition to therapy to home on the endless freeway&#151;recalling Diane's nocturnal journey on Mulholland Drive. "Don't play it for real until it gets real," the bizarre director instructs Betty in MD . Substitute "reel" for "real," and his imperative becomes the best way to enjoy Ellie Parker .
