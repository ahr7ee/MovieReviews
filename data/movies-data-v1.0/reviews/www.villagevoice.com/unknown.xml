      <text>The nifty premise owes a large debt to Memento  and The Usual Suspects , but first-time screenwriter Matthew Waynee  and music video/commercial director Simon Brand  will need more experience before achieving the atmospheric intensity or narrative dexterity of those films. Five battered and bruised men wake up in a locked warehouse, unable to recall who they are or how they got there. Fragmentary memories and a two-day-old newspaper suggest the men were all part of a kidnapping&#151;but fail to indicate on which side of the crime each one stands. The pacing is slightly off, with the action switching between the imprisoned men and the police who are trying to find them, and what should be a mounting sense of urgency inside the warehouse (think Reservoir Dogs ) falters and goes slack.
