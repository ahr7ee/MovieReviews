      <text>Did erstwhile John Hughes  protégé and Harry Potter   progenitor Chris Columbus  fall behind on his payments on a sub-prime mortgage? Or have to pony up for an emergency organ transplant? Even if so, I'm not sure it fully excuses this joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce, set into motion when nerdy valedictorian Dennis Cooverman  (Paul Rust ) uses his commencement address to profess his unrequited love for the titular cheerleading goddess (Hayden Panettiere ). Complications ensue as the numinous Ms. Cooper pays a grad-night visit chez Cooverman with two gal pals in tow and a coked-up Army brat boyfriend (Shawn Roberts ) in hot pursuit. Cue the listless succession of house trashings, party crashings, realizations that beautiful people can be insecure, too, and enough reckless driving to result in a double-digit body count—fitting for a movie that's about as funny as a hit-and-run. At least Columbus and writer Larry Doyle  are up-front about their inspirations, giving Dennis a film-geek BFF (Jack T. Carpenter ) who name-checks Risky Business  and a dad played by none other than Ferris Bueller   wingman Alan Ruck . But why no love for Columbus's own 1987 debut feature, Adventures in Babysitting , which went through these same one-wild-night paces with real ingenuity and pizzazz—and less need to persistently debase its characters? "This isn't fun anymore," says the wise young Cooverman after his third or fourth near-death experience. "Who says it's supposed to be fun?" replies his unattainable lady love. Exactly.
