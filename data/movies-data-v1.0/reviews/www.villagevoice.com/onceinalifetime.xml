      <text>For a brief, shining moment in the late 1970s, soccer was a hot ticket in America. At their peak, the New York Cosmos  drew 77,000 fans to Giants Stadium , and their aging but charismatic stars&#151;Brazilian legend Pelé , Italian schemer Giorgio Chinaglia , unflappable German Franz Beckenbauer &#151;were the toasts of the town, especially at Studio 54, which served as the team training room. This intermittently fascinating documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the Cosmos&#151;which is also the rise and fall of U.S. soccer. The tragicomedy stars Cosmos owner Steve Ross  (then chairman of Warner Communications ) as the blinkered hero, Pelé as the faltering god, and Chinaglia as the dark-eyed villain. Will soccer ever make a comeback here? Not unless Americans decide to watch it on TV: Witnesses for the prosecution would like to blame Chinaglia, but ABC Sports ' dismal soccer ratings in 1979 spelled the doom of the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League  just five years later.
