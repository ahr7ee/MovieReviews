      <text>What a bunch of nonsense&#151;effective nonsense, chilling nonsense, occasionally wrenching nonsense, but nonsense nonetheless. This is what happens when M. Night Shyamalan  tries to play both John Carpenter  (bloody) and Stanley Kubrick  (cold-blooded) while writing and directing what the literalist will either dismiss or embrace as the horror-film extension of An Inconvenient Truth , depending upon who the literalist thinks is responsible for, ya know, killing the planet. No spoilers here, because there&#146;s nothing to give away&#151;not even the alleged cause of the toxin that causes folks in the Northeast to go loopy before killing themselves with whatever&#146;s handy (a cop&#146;s gun, a shard of glass, a sidewalk 40 stories down &#133; a rotor tiller, ick). One minute folks are enjoying themselves in Central Park , the next they&#146;re stabbing and shooting themselves for the following, oh, 90 minutes give or take. (The film&#146;s first 10 minutes are, down to the last second, unrelentingly horrific.) Mark Wahlberg , as a Philly science teacher obsessed with the sudden decline in the bee population, and Zooey Deschanel , as his disinterested missus, plod through the Pennsylvania countryside in search of a safe haven, only they can&#146;t find one; the toxin&#146;s everywhere . But, if nothing else, a couple experiencing a few hiccups&#151;she&#146;s contemplating an affair with the voice of Shyamalan, making one of his more clever cameos&#151;finds it easier to talk shit out when death is imminent. Which is a decent point, even if you have to avoid the piles of corpses on your way to therapy.
