      <text>Sarah Silverman 's cartoon bunny rabbit smile could make her the poster child for orthodontia, but it's her timing that's the real thing of beauty. Silverman's quasi-concert doc Jesus Is Magic  opens with the star tediously regaled by a pair of Hollywood  wannabes (one played by her sister). Defensively, she dreams up her own outrageous success story&#151;a one-woman musical about AIDS and the Holocaust&#151;and then proceeds to stage it. A wicked wittle wabbit who feigns innocence as she courts outrage, Silverman jokes about killing Christ ("I'd fucking do it again in a second if I heard those Birkenstocks  padding up behind me"), makes fun of Martin Luther King , travesties 9-11, and suggests that her grandmother got a "vanity number" at Auschwitz . Her vagina monologue is actually a duet (with a third orifice joining in for the chorus).
Her delivery a seamless blend of psychobabbling TV guest and narcissistic Valley Girl, Silverman never breaks character: "You know what babies love? Ethnic jokes!" In the realm of stand-up Jews, she's neither a Lenny Bruce  philosopher nor a Sandra Bernhard  performance artist. Borderline tiresome, Silverman's racial and sexual obsessions might suggest Jackie Mason  with a pretty face. But really, she's a verbal Jerry Lewis , shamelessly willing to say anything. ("I always feel crappy when I do that joke," she pretends to apologize, "but it gets such a good laugh.") A TV crack got Silverman into trouble with an Asian American media watchdog group. "What kind of world do we live in where a totally cute white girl can't say 'Chink' on network television?" she complains. "It's like the '50s&#151;totally scary. As a member of the Jewish community, I was really concerned that we were losing control of the media."
