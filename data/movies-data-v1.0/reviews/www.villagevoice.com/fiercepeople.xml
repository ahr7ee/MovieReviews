      <text>When 16-year-old Finn (Anton Yelchin ) gets busted scoring drugs for his coke-snorting, alcoholic masseuse of a mother (Diane Lane ), Mom decides what the family really needs is a summer vacation on the estate of a wealthy client, Mr. Osborne (Donald Sutherland ), whose sprawling, Kennedy-like New Jersey compound offers the anthropologically minded Finn a chance to observe the moneyed elite in their natural habitat. Until, that is, he gets a little too close for somebody's comfort to Mr. Osborne and his two grandchildren (Chris Evans  and Kristen Stewart ), which earns him a brutal beating and anal rape from an unidentified assailant on the Osborne grounds. In one of those karmic quirks of the film-releasing calendar, Fierce People , which was directed by Griffin Dunne  and written by Dirk Wittenborn , is finally staggering into theaters&#151;after more than two years on the shelf&#151;barely a fortnight after The Nanny Diaries , that other cautionary tale about a proletariat pea that works its way under the mattress of the sockless-loaf er crowd. Adding to the déjà vu is the presence of Evans as a kind of anthropomorphic Ralph Lauren  ad. But whereas most of the injustices suffered by Nanny 's nanny are of the skin-deep variety, the hopelessly reductive Fierce People  ups the ante: It says, in effect, tangle with these crazy rich, white folks and they will&#151;quite literally&#151;fuck you up the ass.
