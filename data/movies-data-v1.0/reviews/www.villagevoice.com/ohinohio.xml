      <text>Priscilla (Parker Posey ) has never had an orgasm, and even though her high school teacher hubby Jack (Paul Rudd ) admits she's great in the sack, he's being driven to drink by the fact that there is no known way to satisfy her. Priscilla's job is to woo big business to Cleveland, which might be a lot easier if she were to realize what may be Ohio's biggest selling point: that the age of consent is only 16&#151;which Jack's star pupil (Mischa Barton ) knows well. First-time feature director Billy Kent  seems proud that his movie deals with sex in such frank fashion. But if you're going to brag about your explicit sexuality, it doesn't quite work to go out of your way avoiding skin. Every actor here probably has a no-nudity clause, but for a film like this, it might have been better for the story&#151;and the box office&#151;to find a cast that doesn't. Except for Danny DeVito  and Liza Minnelli &#151;their clothes can stay.
