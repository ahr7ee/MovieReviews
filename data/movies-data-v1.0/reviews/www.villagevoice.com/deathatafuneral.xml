      <text>After unwisely hitching up with those costly Stepford Wives ,  director Frank Oz  gets drawing-room small with a proper English farce set solely within the confines of a country house, where frumpy, grumpy Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen ), his bestselling bro Robert (Rupert Graves ), and their family and friends have come to bury their father. Like Oz's best films ( Dirty Rotten Scoundrels , What About Bob? , and Bowfinger ), Funeral  obscures its sincerity behind a veil of misanthropy; before we can get to the touching eulogy, we first must encounter an accidentally acid-doused attorney (Alan Tudyk ) and his exasperated fianc√©e (Daisy Donovan ), a cranky wheelchair-bound uncle in dire need of a crapper (Peter Vaughan ), a short American possessing dark secrets about dear ol' dead dad (Peter Dinklage ), and assorted other relatives with little tea left in their bags. Yet for all its spot-on performances (Macfadyen's particularly good), clever dialogue, and wacky gags&#151;Tudyk winds up extremely naked on a rooftop just before Dinklage winds up riding shotgun in a coffin&#151; Death at a Funeral never even approaches the best of Oz's oeuvre. It's his first movie that begs for the laugh track; they'll love it on BBC America .
