"My name is Tracey Berkowitz . Fifteen. Just a normal girl who hates herself." Again leading as a deadpan, snarky, eponymous na√Øf dealing with issues way beyond her maturity level, Juno &#146;s Ellen Page  confesses to the camera an angry, diaristic account of how her bullied dreamer wound up in the back of a bus, naked beneath a shower curtain, searching for her hypnotized brother. Replicating the splintered prose of Maureen Medved &#146;s novel-cum-screenplay, cult Canadian director Bruce McDonald  (Highway 61 ) reveals the murky details&#151;some true, others defense-mechanism fantasies in Tracey&#146;s brooding rock-star brain&#151;entirely in dynamic split-screen shards, linearity be damned. Unlike the frustrating gimmickry of Mike Figgis &#146;s Timecode  and Hotel , McDonald&#146;s bedazzling multi-frame experiment poeticizes and enhances an otherwise slender story (forgivable at only 77 minutes long), as planes of different sizes and shapes materialize&#151;fading, sliding, distorting, and overlapping to convey the rage and anxiety of damaged adolescence. Funhouse-cloned images giddily intensify disturbing moments, hazy memories take the form of asymmetric repetitions, and walls literally close in. Beyond its overarching aesthetic, The Tracey Fragments   co-stars Toronto rockabilly punk Slim Twig  as a Tim Burton  caricature of Pretty in Pink &#146;s Duckie and boasts a score by Broken Social Scene ; it would all swagger dangerously close into hipster-trash territory if not for Page&#146;s pathos and wit, honest to blog.
