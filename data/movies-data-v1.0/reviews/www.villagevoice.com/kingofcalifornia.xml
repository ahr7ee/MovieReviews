      <text>Michael Douglas  is a mental patient on the loose, out to liberate Spanish gold buried beneath a Costco &#151;or maybe a Petco , or perhaps that Applebee&#146;s over yonder. Bushy-bearded, wild-eyed and dressed like an art-directed hobo, Douglas looks like he&#146;s working on a Wonder Boys  sequel; if only. Instead, we&#146;re merely off to Crazytown, with Evan Rachel Wood  along for the bumpy ride as Douglas&#146;s poor, put-upon daughter who finds her solitary, humdrum existence&#151;nights working at McDonald&#146;s, days wandering the empty house&#151;ruined by the return of her nutty pops, who somehow convinces the pragmatic teen to go on late-night and roadside scavenger hunts armed with only a metal detector, some old journals, and a gardener&#146;s shovel. Hard to tell what&#146;s more annoying in this empty character study of eccentrics and the suckers who love them: the braying, blurting soundtrack or Douglas himself, who can&#146;t find his way into a man tortured by dull demons. As for Wood, there&#146;s but one saving grace: At least she doesn&#146;t have to sing Beatles  songs, as she&#146;s forced to do in Across the Universe . That automatically renders King of California  her best bad film of 2007, hands down.
