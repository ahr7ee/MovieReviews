      <text>In director Steve Pink 's amiable but undernourished campus comedy, industrious high school underachiever Bartleby Gaines  (Justin Long ) gets rejected from every college under the sun. So he starts his own, the South Harmon Institute of Technology , complete with facilities (an abandoned mental hospital), faculty, and fully functional website where admission is, quite literally, a click away. Soon, S.H.I.T. becomes a mecca for all the huddled masses turned away by the legitimate university system. The joke, of course, is that the "fake" college is no worse&#151;and in some ways better&#151;than the high-ticket institute of higher learning down the road with its stuck-up faculty and humiliating frat-hazing rituals. But Accepted  is an inspired premise in search of a movie: What starts out as a scabrous takedown of academic bureaucracy ends up yet another modestly rousing underdog story about the little slacker that could. The cheat sheet in Pink's loose-leaf binder is Long, who's great fun to watch as he moves through the film with the shit-eating confidence of the kid voted most likely to succeed . . . at grand larceny.
