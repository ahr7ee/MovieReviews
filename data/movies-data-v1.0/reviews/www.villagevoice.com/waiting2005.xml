      <text>A day in the life at chain restaurant Shenanigan's, Waiting . . . makes a predictable pit stop to elaborately mess with a creep patron's food but otherwise exceeds expectations by handling the real, soul-sucking fears of the double shift. What survives in a greenhouse of marathon desperation? Besides the waiters&#151;Ryan Reynolds  trying to quip away humiliation and bang the underage hostess, his desirably sluttish ex, the nice girl who gets screwed on tips, the bug-eyed chain-smoking careerist, the earnest up-and-comer-&#151;there's the power-struck manager and the obscene head chef (a role eaten up by Luis Guzm√°n ). Chef saved the flagging restaurant years ago by inventing the sanity-saving Game: An employee stealthily exposes his cock and/or balls in contortions like the Goat or Batwing, hoping to catch a male co-worker looking, whom he then gets to kick in the ass. It's a great bit, but to director Rob McKittrick 's credit, the funniest scene is also the saddest: The kitchen crew, having cleaned up, watching the clock like New Year's, goes nuts when a couple is seated a minute before closing. This is pain.
