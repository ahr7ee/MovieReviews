      <text>With shtick as dull as it is ill-natured, this tasteless inversion of the Cinderella story features the voice of Sigourney Weaver  as a generically shrieky wicked stepmother who discovers she can tinker with fairy-tale endings, notably that of Cinders (Sarah Michelle Gellar ), who sports a short black Audrey Hepburn  'do and a mistaken crush on a narcissistic prince (Patrick Warburton ) brazenly ripped off from Beauty and the Beast 's Gaston. Remember those fabulously giddy bits in Shrek   that riffed on just about every fairy-tale character known to Western man? Well, here director Paul J. Bolger  and screenwriter Rob Moreland  have drained the affectionate wit out of the Shrek  franchise's satire, giving us instead a barely sketched out story line and quantities of unimaginative CGI. I spent the movie scratching my head over which audience Lionsgate is hoping to tap with this noisy rubbish. YouTubers? Tots with A.D.D.?
