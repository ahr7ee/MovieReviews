      <text>Will the circle be unbroken? Let's hope not. This poorly conceived sequel to Gore Verbinski 's The Ring  ditches that film's scariest conceit&#151;people die a week after watching . . . an avant-garde video! &#151;for a watery possession plot. Fleeing the gnarliness unleashed in the first movie's Seattle  for small-town life, Rachel (Naomi Watts ) and her weird little son (David Dorfman ) have to fend off bad plumbing, angry deer, and the unshowered ghost girl who keeps ruining his digital photos. Postpartum depression is invoked several times; if the name of the game is to be the unheimlich  maneuvers of the mother-child bond, one wishes Hideo Nakata  (director of the Japanese Ringu  films) could have nudged the proceedings toward the Rosemary's Baby -Birth  axis. (Indeed, there's a brief, wordless melody intended to evoke RB .) Sissy Spacek , as the would-be Andrea Yates  now in the loony bin, is thankfully obscured by a long wig. The let's-travel-through-the-TV-screen sequence was better in Fat Albert  . Next time we'll try call-waiting.
