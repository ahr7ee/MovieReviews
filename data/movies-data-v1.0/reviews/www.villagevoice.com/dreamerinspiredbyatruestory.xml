      <text>It's about a quick-footed horse, but Dreamer 's only feat is winding up slower than Seabiscuit . Adults will be restless as stabled bucks, but even children may need unusually high Ritalin  doses to slog through the visual and dramatic indifference on display. "Inspired by a true story" generally translates to "prompted by a true story but reconstituted as a clich√© pileup." A promising horse is injured, but father (Kurt Russell ) and daughter (Dakota Fanning ) don't kill it, for sentimental reasons. Eventually Russell transfers ownership to Fanning, leading to race-qualifying meetings where the pre-teen holds her own alongside adult trainers&#151;except for meanie David Morse , who upbraids his twee colleague in public. Dad worries about losing money, but Grandpa (a grizzled Kris Kristofferson ) encourages the girl to follow her racetrack dreams. Meanwhile, viewers will be encouraged to sleep, to dream of better movies.
