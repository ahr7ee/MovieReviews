      <text>The 15th film in 35 years written and directed by Henry Jaglom , that love-him-or-hate-him iconoclast of American independent filmmaking, is also one of his warmest, despite the potential for cynicism inherent in its premise&#151;that old saw about a would-be starlet (newcomer Tanna Frederick ) living out of her car and scrounging for a gig. The movie buzzes with the quirky rhythms of Jaglom's patented improvisational shooting style, and those of Frederick herself, whose go-for-broke zaniness recalls that of a former Jaglom ingenue, Karen Black . By the time Black appears here, as an actress musing with a mix of melancholy and acceptance about her former stardom, it's clear that Hollywood  Dreams  is something of a walk down memory lane for its own maker. Consider it a wistful contemplation of the fickle nature of movie success.
