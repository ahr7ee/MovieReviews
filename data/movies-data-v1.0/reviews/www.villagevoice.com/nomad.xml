Centuries before Sacha Baron Cohen  made Kazakhstan  hip, the Eurasian territory was inhabited by nomadic tribes whose refusal to band together left them vulnerable to marauding invaders. This sweeping historical drama follows the rough outlines of Kazakh history through the tale of Ablai Khan, who unified the feuding societies just in time to beat back the plundering hordes. Widescreen cinematography captures the austere beauty of the semi-arid, windswept steppes and the cast of B-picture, handsome Western actors&#151;Mexico's Kuno Becker  and Americans Jay Hernandez  and Jason Scott Lee &#151;who convey appropriate stoicism, though not much real emotion. With commendable sincerity but also an unfortunate Hollywood  veneer, Nomad  is a poor man's Gladiator .
