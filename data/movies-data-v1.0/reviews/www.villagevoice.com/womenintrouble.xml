      <text>With more references to vaginas than Our Bodies, Ourselves,  Sebastian Gutierrez 's Almodóvar-in-the-'80s accented comedy isn't quite the unequivocal embrace of pussy power it tries to be. Featuring a criss-crossing, virtually all-distaff cast—including Gutierrez's real-life girlfriend, Carla Gugino , as patient porn star Elektra Luxx, and kid, Isabella Gutierrez , as weirdo tween Charlotte —Women in Trouble  awkwardly mixes blue material with sob stories. Elektra and her XXX castmate, Holly Rocket (Adrianne Palicki , smartly playing a dumb blonde), who moonlights on occasion with working girl Bambi (Emmanuelle Chriqui ), provide both raunch and emotional sustenance during random encounters with other characters: Holly and Bambi dry the eyes of a betrayed therapist, while Elektra counsels a conflicted mother. Though his film is more fun—and much less insulting—than Diane English 's abominable remake of The Women , Gutierrez (who wrote the scripts for Gothika  and Snakes on a Plane ) still lapses into WE TV  hokum ("If we don't tell people how we feel, what are we doing here?") and seems wildly anxious about the delta of Venus. Josh Brolin , in bad Keith Richards  drag, suffers misfortune while orally pleasuring Marley Shelton 's flight attendant; Holly, who has the hots for Bambi, is incapable of going down without throwing up. You can't successfully deliver a vagina monologue with such a sensitive gag reflex.
