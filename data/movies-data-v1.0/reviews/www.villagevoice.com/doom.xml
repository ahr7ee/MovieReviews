      <text>Yes, Doom  is a bad movie but you already knew that. If you have no patience for loud, illogical spectacles you don't need to be told to skip this one. If, however, you have a taste for mindless mayhem in the context of a video-game-inspired, zombies-on-Mars plot . . . "Hesitate and people die," ringleader Sarge (The Rock) warns wobbly-kneed rookie The Kid at the outset of their high-risk mission to a quarantined Martian laboratory. Adopting this maxim of recklessness, Doom  plows through 100 absurdly frenetic, whiplash-inducing minutes. Light on plot points that make sense, the story involves mutant monsters on Mars that are killing (maybe) human scientists indiscriminately (perhaps). Sarge's band of elite&#151;and mostly deranged&#151;Marines is naturally prepared to do battle with the slimy beasts; they are also armed to the teeth with guns that make The Rock's BALCO -sized biceps look like little twigs. As dumb as they come, the entertaining Doom  might warrant a place in cinema history as the first movie in which someone rips off their own  ear.
