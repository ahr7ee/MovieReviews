      <text>No doubt about it, Alison Eastwood  has picked up a thing or two from her old man. Her debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for place&#151;none of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes that tie this hackneyed domestic drama together with fearsome symmetry. A child in need of parents, parents in need of a child&#151;what else is necessary to complicate the passage from A to B to redemption but suicide, cancer, and a difficult marriage? The acting is great, though it may be time for Kevin Bacon &#151;playing a train conductor faced with a difficult decision about the car parked in a fast-approaching crossing&#151;to take a break from the man-of-few-words thing. Marcia Gay Harden  is much too good for her role here as the afflicted wife who "doesn't want to relax, I want to live." (Clich√©s by Micky Levy, who cobbled them together after a train journey of her own.) Newcomer Miles Heizer is excellent as the forlorn lad, but there's no saving this mawkish tale&#151;whose best feature is its sense of railway life, and whose worst is its reduction of life's common hurts and losses to puppetry.
