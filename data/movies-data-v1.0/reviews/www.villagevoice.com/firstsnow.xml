      <text>Destiny is as loophole-free as an IRS  audit in this appointment-in-Samarra  yarn from Children of Men  screenwriters Mark Fergus  and Hawk Ostby , in which cocky salesman Jimmy Starks  (Guy Pearce ) risks the love of his doting girlfriend (Piper Perabo ), not to mention his life and sanity, to avoid a fortune-teller's ominous reading. The presence of Memento 's Pearce, the poster boy for narrative dislocation, would seem to herald yet another gimmicky puzzle movie about the interconnectedness of every speck of dust and the hair-trigger whims of the space-time continuum. But first-time director Fergus's film is more a moody, tedious anti-thriller about ineluctable fate. And speaking of fate, is it written somewhere that every indie quasi-noir must include a dripping faucet, ceiling fans, shadows of slatted blinds, and a traveling shot of highway lines? As surely as Fergus's establishing shot of the desert must begin with a tumbleweed.
