      <text>Mental disease is too often reduced in film to self-destructive eccentricity, sensationalist melodrama, or vilifying thrills. But as endorsed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness , writer-director Joseph Greco 's convincing feature debut tries something more daring by depicting an entirely average Florida family's struggles with schizophrenia. The patient in question is Mary Marino  (Marcia Gay Harden ), a hobby painter already showing signs of instability by the time we're introduced to the whole clan: Her hubby John (a riveting Joe Pantoliano ) is a hump-busting construction worker whose marital devotion remains steadfast no matter how many times the cops are called in, and their 10-year-old son Chris (newcomer Devon Gearhart)&#151;who vents his confusion and humiliation through school rebellion&#151;is largely the heart and entrance to the story. Through the young towhead's eyes, puppy love becomes a welcome distraction from the one-two punch of Mom's institutionalization and Dad's descent into neglect and full-blown denial. Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas  falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion.
