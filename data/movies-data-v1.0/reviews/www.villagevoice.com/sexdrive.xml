Between his unsympathetic family and his demeaning doughnut-shop job, the likable-but-luckless Ian (Josh Zuckerman ) is a prototypical teen-movie protagonist with a prototypical teen-movie conflict: He's still a virgin. Naturally, a prototypical solution must follow. With his two best friends (played by Amanda Crew  and Clark Duke ), Ian steals his brother's 1969 Pontiac GTO  and embarks on a road trip to hook up with his Internet crush. Heralded by Porky's  and perfected by John Hughes , the post-pubescent sex comedy is a genre as identifiable as the film noir or the western, and Sex Drive  doesn't miss any of the motifs. Sweet muscle car? Check. Terroristic older sibling? Check. (In frosted tips and cut-off sweatshirt, James Marsden  relishes the role.) Ample amounts of T&amp;A? Check. Yet, rather than wink at adults with a knowing rehash of early '80s iconography, director and co-writer Sean Anders  aims for the only audience that counts: the youth of today. Like Superbad , Sex Drive  maintains its belief that the average modern teenager is funnier and more compelling than the stereotyped hipsters of Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist  or the fantastic figurines of High School Musical . Even as Ian's journey detours into National Lampoon  â€“like farce, the movie remains faithful to a portrait of teens as they see themselves.
