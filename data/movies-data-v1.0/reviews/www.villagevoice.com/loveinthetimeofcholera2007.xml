      <text>Easily the worst adaptation of a major novel by a Nobel Prize&#150;winning author. Easily . Director Mike Newell  and writer Ronald Harwood  have rendered Gabriel García Márquez 's novel little more than a sudsy telenovela&#151;Lifetime by way of Telemundo . Not that the material didn't teeter and totter in that direction to begin with: The story of Florentino Ariza 's 50-year crush on Fermina Daza  was always little more than a variation on Romeo and Juliet , only tinged with the flowery scent of magical realism. But there ain't a damned thing real&#151;magical or otherwise&#151;about this abomination, which stars a wasted Javier Bardem  as Florentino and Giovanna Mezzogiorno  as Fermina, who ditches Florentino for a doctor (Benjamin Bratt , who's always been a little made-for-TV anyway). From the hoot-worthy dialogue ("I don't need a medical lesson." "No, this is going to be a lesson in love") to the atrocious makeup, to the dead rats taped to the side of Hector Elizondo 's head, the entire thing's a wreck. Unless it was trolling for sneering chuckles, in which case&#151;success!
