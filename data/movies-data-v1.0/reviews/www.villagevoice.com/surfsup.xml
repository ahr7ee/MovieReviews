      <text>The cash-cow flippered ones rise again, this time as yellow-tufted surfer dudes riding the waves of life off the coast of an island that looks like a cross between Hawaii  and Venice Beach . If you have to see another penguin blockbuster, you could do worse than this loose-limbed charmer written by, oh, a lot of jokesters and directed by a scant two, Ash Brannon  and Chris Buck . The gimmick is a reality-television premise&#151;just how knowingly ironic do we want our kids to be before they even hit their tweens?&#151;but don't expect much fresh by way of plot, which is almost identical to that of Cars  and every bit as pregnant with wholesome messaging. Shia LaBeouf  voices Cody, a cocky but insecure Rockhopper penguin sorely in need of a father figure, who bonds with a washed-up old champion surfer (a delightful Jeff Bridges ) to train for a big surf-off, during which, it goes without saying, both learn to redefine the meaning of winning. As always, the energy comes from a manic supporting cast, of whom the funniest hands-down is James Woods 's Don King &#150;like surf promoter. Surf's Up  is copycat movie-making at its smoothest; its one imaginative innovation&#151;billowing, silky, utterly sexy waves&#151;is technical.
