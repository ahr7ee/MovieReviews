      <text>Though not to be confused with Zero Day  or Germany, Year Zero , Bryan Gunnar Cole 's Day Zero  similarly stands at the brink of disaster. In the not-so-distant future, a terrorist attack in Los Angeles escalates the War on Terror and the draft is reinstated. Three friends from different class divides&#151;rich (Chris Klein ), poor (Jon Bernthal ), and hobbit (Elijah Wood )&#151;are all called to duty and cope with their obligation to their country by engaging in all manner of histrionic self-destruction, from sleeping with whores to boozing . . . in the shower! Sabotaged by trite political dissertation and the presumption of novelty, the story forces Klein to shoulder much of the film's white-male-hetero paranoia. "I just made partner," his character says before going through LaBute-ian motions of desperation, from nearly chopping off his hand and asking Daddy to pull senatorial strings to spazzing out at a gay bar (in near-perfect sync with a techno beat) because&#151;no joke&#151;he isn't programmed to swallow cum. With ludicrous gravity and a narrow-minded view of courage and conviction, the film's what-if scenario is presented as a reality check to every ostensibly unimaginative male who's come of age in the draftless years since Vietnam . One caveat: The many shots of the New York skyline are haunting, as if a military or monster attack could bring it all down in the blink of an eye.
