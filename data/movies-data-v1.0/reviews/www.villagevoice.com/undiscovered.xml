      <text>A PG-13 dramedy set in L.A. about some attractive, way-too-earnest aspiring stars has the potential to be a delectable good-bad favorite, but Undiscovered  is nowhere near the guilty pleasure it could have been. One, Ashlee Simpson  is no Britney. Two, she's not even the star in her own star vehicle. Instead, the spotlight is on a love affair between a bland version of Kelly from 90210  (Pell James ) and an unfortunately ponytailed musician (Steven Strait ), facing the ups and downs of burgeoning fame. These guys give us nothing to work with&#151;no priceless cheesy lines, no shocking scandals, not even a steamy sex scene&#151;just two tortured artists passing up a chance to get laid. Their friend, Simpson's vaguely cute Clea, while not quite pulling off the hipster-cool chick she's supposed to be (who did  choose those outfits?), is a relief from the couple's Dawson's Creek   banter. Above all, Undiscovered  makes poor Ash the latest example of a fascinating paradox: jack-of-all-trades celebrities who are famous for no good reason.
