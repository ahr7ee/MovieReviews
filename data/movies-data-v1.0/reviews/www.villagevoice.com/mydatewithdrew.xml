      <text>Roger &amp; Me  not only opened doors for a new, more raffish school of populist muckrakers but also suggested a novel approach for young directors seeking distribution. Stalk a celebrity&#151;in Michael Moore 's case, GM exec Roger Smith &#151;and presto: You're a celebrity yourself. In My Date With Drew , aspiring filmmaker Brian Herzlinger  assigns himself one month to snag a date with lifelong crush Drew Barrymore . (Circuit City 's return policy expires after 30 days, and he plans to give the camera back.) Never mind that telling people you want a date with Drew for your movie is not  the same as asking Drew for a date; Herzlinger's mugging is intermittently charming anyway, in part because his shit-eating grin and blind optimism would complement Barrymore's endearing na√Øvete. "I'm scared to death that I'm gonna look like an idiot," he tells his friends. (Too late.) Herzlinger visits Charlie's Angels  scribe John August , an L.A. facialist to the stars, and Barrymore's clueless first cousin. He has difficulty booking Andy Dick , but oddly, no trouble securing an evening with Drew's ex-flame Corey Feldman . When our hero finally does get his moment in the sun&#151;c'mon, would someone have bought the movie if he didn't?&#151;My Date With Drew  offers the surreal spectacle of pursuer and pursued pleasantly gabbing, obliviously immersed in a mutual PR stunt. It's only a matter of time before we see My Skirmish With Scarlett , My Cuddle With Keira  , and My Lap Dance With Lindsay .
