      <text>David Duchovny  and Julianne Moore  play a married couple on the downside of their vows. He's a former ad man who's now a stay-at-home daddy, and she's a movie actress stooping to conquer the Lincoln Center  stage. She's lost all sexual interest in Tom, to the point where she flinches if he so much as touches her. Writer-director Bart Freundlich (Moore's husband) has nothing to say and nowhere to go with this material, except to the most contrived ending this side of a Will &amp; Grace  episode. His characters don't mean anything because they don't say anything or do anything that feels rooted in the nitty-gritty of the everyday. They're stock schmucks and little more&#151;unlikable twerps who don't earn or deserve their happily ever afters.
