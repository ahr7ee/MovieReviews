      <text>First Steve Coogan , in Tristram Shandy , and now Zooey Deschanel  offer a cappella renditions of "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" on-screen this season, perhaps signaling a celluloid renaissance of aqueous Scottish melancholy. Otherwise, Winter Passing  is chiefly notable for reuniting musically inclined Elf  sweethearts Deschanel and Will Ferrell , whose department store bathroom duet on "Baby, It's Cold Outside" was definitive until The Power of Nightmares  permanently recontextualized the tune. Adam Rapp 's first feature casts Deschanel as Reese, a sullen and possibly disturbed East Village  actress wandering in a druggy fog of bad sex, self-harm, and forever-February malaise. After she's approached by a book editor (Amy Madigan ) who's keen to publish the letters between Reese 's novelist parents, Reese travels to her hometown in Michigan, where her reclusive widower father (Ed Harris , outdoing even his ham-tastic turn in The Hours ) has set up camp with his English ex-student (Amelia Warner ) and a childlike handyman (Ferrell) as his informal staff. The film is so grindingly predictable that I was writing out a full plot synopsis in my notebook before it was half over, though the thick grains of Terry Stacey's photography and Deschanel's understated performance add a little kick to the family-dysfunction paces, and Ferrell's dive-bar rendition of the Eagles' "I Can't Tell You Why" is positively riveting. Winter Passing  should have been a musical.
