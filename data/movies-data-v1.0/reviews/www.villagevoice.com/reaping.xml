      <text>Those two age-old foes&#151;science and blind faith&#151;tango yet again in this noxious slice of Biblical horror about a series of Old Testament plagues being visited upon a Louisiana bayou backwater. Hilary Swank  stars as the resident nonbeliever, an ordained minister turned university professor recruited by a rural schoolteacher (David Morrissey ) to convince the locals that there's a perfectly rational explanation (global warming?) for why their once crystalline lake has turned into a crimson tide pool. In short order, frogs rain from the heavens, bad CGI cattle drop dead in their tracks, and hideous boils break out on human skin, until Swank starts to wonder if maybe she was wrong to turn her back on the Lord after her husband and daughter were killed on a missionary trip to the Sudan . Cue overexposed flashbacks of ooga-booga tribesmen.
