      <text>David Duchovny &#146;s dreary directorial debut doesn&#146;t deliver
Like the new Jonathan Safran Foer  novel, David Duchovny's directorial debut, House of D , uses a flipbook in the service of wishful thinking. Duchovny plays Thomas, an American artist in Paris who dwells on the events of his 13th year, as a Greenwich Village  kid circa 1973, upon the occasion of his own son's 13th birthday. Marred by a rambling voice-over at one end and a pat therapeutic resolution on the other, the film has a nice half-hour patch somewhere in the middle, in which the younger Tommy (Anton Yelchin , smart and sensitive) navigates prep school and puppy love before entering a downward spiral.
His best friend is Pappass (Robin Williams ), the school janitor and a fellow butcher-store employee. Selectively retarded, Pappass can sagely remark that "Places change like people change," yet can't help himself from blurting things like "I have a huge penis." Duchovny spouse TÃ©a Leoni  plays Tommy's mom (paging Dr. Freud!), a depressed widow who leaves her cigarettes in the toilet, targets for Tommy to pee on. For advice on girls,
Tommy yelps his woes to "Lady" (Erykah Badu ), an upper-floor resident of the Women's House of Detention. The concatenation of setbacks following Tommy's attendance at a school dance is swift and hysterical. The extended soul-hug (spurred by Thomas's French wife, who says, "A man ees a man only when 'e can be eemself wherever 'e ees") approaches the grotesque, but at least Yelchin occasionally lends this too heartfelt film an actual heart.
