      <text>Genius weighs heavily on a child prodigy who longs to be "normal" in this charming Swiss import from veteran director Fredi M. Murer . Kicked out of kindergarten for being too smart, Vitus is both a brilliant mathematician and a musical virtuoso&#150;but he is still a child emotionally, something his well-intentioned parents fail to see. Only his beloved grandfather (Bruno Ganz ) allows him to be an ordinary, mischievous boy, and Vitus increasingly seeks refuge with him. Tired of being exceptional, Vitus plots a way out of his dilemma. Blissfully devoid of both sentimentality and melodrama, the story takes a few fantastical turns toward the end that dampen the realism but serve the film's larger message. Impeccably acted, Vitus  rests most squarely on the shoulders of two superb, young first-time performers: Fabrizio Borsani , who plays the yonger Vitus, and Teo Gheorghiu , a real-life piano prodigy, who plays Vitus at 12.
