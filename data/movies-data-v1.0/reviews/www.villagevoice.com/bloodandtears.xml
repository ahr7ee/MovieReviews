      <text>A well-balanced primer on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Blood and Tears  takes just over an hour to go from the roots of Zionism to the recent electoral victory of Hamas . Workmanlike at best, with a regrettable tendency toward cheap filters and effects, the film's strength lies in its remarkable list of interviews. To name just a few: former Israeli prime ministers Shimon Peres , Benjamin Netanyahu , and Ehud Barak ; Palestinian politicians Saeb Erekat  and Sari Nusseibeh ; assassinated Hamas leader Abdel Azis al-Rantissi ; and controversial Middle East scholars Bernard Lewis  and Rashid Khalidi . Those aren't the kind of gets you'd expect from a doc that's barely made it past the university circuit. Still, most espouse the standard narratives. There is one remarkable moment, from the distinguished Israeli historian Michael Oren . Recounting an assault on a Hamas compound that left 23 Israeli soldiers dead, Oren says that given the choice between flattening the compound with a missile or sending his son door-to-door&#151;he'd send his son door-to-door.
