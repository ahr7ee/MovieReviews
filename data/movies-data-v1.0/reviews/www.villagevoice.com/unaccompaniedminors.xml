      <text>Freaks and Geeks creator Paul Feig  certainly knows how to cast talented young actors, but in this instance, he doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with them. So while Tyler James Williams  ( Everybody Hates Chris  ), Dyllan Christopher  ( Seabiscuit ), Brett Kelly  ( Bad Santa ), Gina Mantegna  (daughter of Joe), and Quinn Shephard  are all appealing, the series of forced slapstick scenarios they endure are not. (Memo to Feig: "That's gotta hurt!" is not a punchline.) Stranded at an airport on Christmas Eve, the five minors amuse themselves by running around, stealing things, and pissing off security officer Lewis Black  (surely no great feat, that). Anyone who has ever actually been stuck in a terminal with rowdy youngsters will not likely choose to pay money to revisit that experience on-screen.
