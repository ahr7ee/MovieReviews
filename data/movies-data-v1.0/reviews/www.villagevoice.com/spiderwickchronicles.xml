      <text>Freud lives and prospers in The Spiderwick Chronicles , an exceptionally Oedipal fantasy adventure stuffed with defaulting dads ripe for slaying; a freshly single mom (Mary-Louise Parker ); and one majorly split personality, also known as her twin sons, intelligently played by British child actor Freddie Highmore . Steamed over their family's abrupt move&#151;minus dad&#151;to a ramshackle New England  house that once belonged to mom's great-uncle (David Strathairn ), the boys soon find themselves in a fearsomely funny nether world, where they meet a pig-faced hobgoblin voiced by Seth Rogen  and a monster played by Mr. Id himself, Nick Nolte . The movie's richly autumnal look is by swift turns cozily naturalistic and terrifyingly baroque, and director Mark Waters  (Freaky Friday , Mean Girls ) sustains the balance between real and surreal with mischievous brio. But CGI is a seductive mistress, and it's a pity that toward the end, Spiderwick  bogs down in too many effects and too much action, before fizzling into tearful reconciliation on all fronts.
