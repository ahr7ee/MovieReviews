      <text>Bad Santa gets worse every time he trots out the same mean routine; does anyone at this late date recall a movie starring Billy Bob Thornton  in which he doesn&#146;t yell at retarded fucking kids and bark at their stupid parents? After coaching the Bad News Bears  to ruin and flunking out of the half-witted School for Scoundrels , Thornton&#146;s forcing kids to take a lap while pelting them with basketballs in Mr. Woodcock  Among Mr. Woodcock&#146;s poor pupils is a chunky lad who grows into a self-help guru (Seann William Scott ) that looks a lot like Stifler from American Pie , and returns home in best-selling triumph only to discover his mom (Susan Sarandon , poor gal) has shacked up with Woodcock. And in a single instant, the self-help guru is self-helpless in the same house as his childhood tormentor, with whom he wars till the final few scenes in which all&#146;s well that ends well&#151;and if you think that&#146;s a spoiler, you&#146;ve clearly never been to a movie. Amy Poehler  ekes out a smirk or two as a boozy broad publicist trying to keep her paycheck in check, but even the best gags feel like leftovers, again . In other words, Woodcock &#146;s a strictly flaccid family affair. Bet you saw that coming too.
