      <text>Despite that curious "Martin Scorsese  presents" credit, Brooklyn  Lobster  is almost entirely home cooked: a movie inspired by the story of a family lobster farm, directed and produced by two of the farm's heirs (Kevin Jordan , of Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire , and his brother Darren). Perhaps, like the characters in the film, everyone involved feared going franchise would spoil the broth. But outside of the Jordan inner circle, this family-versus-business parable comes across as slight, familiar, and in dire need of seasoning. Danny Aiello  plays irritable Frank Giorgio , the longtime owner of a Sheepshead Bay  lobster farm that faces foreclosure thanks to a defaulted bank loan. Not particularly sympathetic, Frank talks down to the hearing judge and shouts at anyone with the impertinence to consider buying his company. Frank's dotcom-chasing son (Daniel Sauli ) is on hand to declare his father's behavior impractical; he also plans to propose to his girlfriend (Heather Burns ), a plot development with the dramatic interest of a pile of dead seaweed. Frank's estranged wife (Jane Curtin ) claims to have moved out because "there's not much to say about crustaceans." The same could be said of Brooklyn Lobster .
