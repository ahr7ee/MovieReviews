      <text>After this cutesy whodunit adapted from Richard Stevenson 's long-running mystery series, the late Mickey Spillane  must be spinning in his crypt. Not because it features a gay private eye&#151;let alone one who makes his first big appearance bobbing up from his husband's lap&#151;but because it packs all the pulpy authenticity of rotgut served from a teapot. In his second outing (after last year's Third Man Out ) as Stevenson's Albany - based shamus Donald Strachey , Chad Allen  again flexes the hard-boiled chops he honed on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman  . Here, the suave gumshoe with the Bloomsbury  namesake and the absurdly vanilla spouse (Sebastian Spence ) goes undercover to check out a shady conversion-therapy clinic, dodging bullets, hit-and-run attempts, and the hungry looks of a recovering boy toy (Shawn Roberts ) whose conversion ain't exactly taking. Tentatively mixing homage, genre subversion, and quippy Remington Steele &#150;style Detective Lite, director Ron Oliver  applies a thin veneer of straight-to-cable pseudo-gloss without finding a workable tone, and the cast lacks the charisma and chemistry to make the genre and gender-bending register as more than novelty: In this crew, as a sinister dowager, '80s prime-time soap queen Morgan Fairchild  stands out like Isabelle Huppert .
