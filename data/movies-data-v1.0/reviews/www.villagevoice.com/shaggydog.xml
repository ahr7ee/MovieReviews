      <text>After being bitten by a 300-year-old Buddhist canine that U.S. government commandos have snatched from Tibet  (this is what it takes to make a dog movie exportable?), a workaholic family man and inveterate pooch-hater (Tim Allen ) starts scratching behind the ears, hearing high-pitched sounds, slurping milk from the cereal bowl, and licking his wife's face. And the grown-up viewer starts checking his watch. Disney 's tried-and-true slapstick material (est. 1959) is here given a heinously unimaginative interpretation by five screenwriters and a director who manages to squander the gifts of an absurdly overqualified supporting cast. The bit players (Robert Downey Jr. , Danny Glover , Jane Curtin , Philip Baker Hall ) barely clock screen time with the Bearded Collie, which may be co-producer Allen's way of protecting his sleepy performance from competition. Where the original film generously reflected Cold War angst and budding youth-culture dissent, this dad-in-the-doghouse tract could've been made in 1995 . . . or 1985. My eight-year-old nephew sat nearly silent throughout, so when he says he had fun, he must be talking about the treats.
