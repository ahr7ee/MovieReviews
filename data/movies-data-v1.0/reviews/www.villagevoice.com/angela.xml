What if you took It's a Wonderful Life  and replaced George Bailey  with a scruffy Parisian con man and swapped Henry Travers 's doddering guardian angel for the half-naked chick with the $10 million pasties from Brian De Palma 's Femme Fatale ? You'd wind up in the humid imagination of writer-director Luc Besson . In this amiably inconsequential fairy tale, one-armed Morocco -born comic Jamel Debbouze  draws on his scrappy charm as a quick-talking Brooklyn -based loser who's about to jump into the Seine  to avoid his gambling debts when suddenly a literal suicide blonde (Rie Rasmussen ) materializes on the same bridge. When the leggy sprite and her companion aren't wandering a desolate City of Lights&#151;shot in silvery black-and-white&#151;the portentously named Angela throws roundhouse kicks in a bid to restore her man's latent decency. Is she the director's muse? Is expat Debbouze's love-hate relationship with Paris symbolic of Besson's own tenuous position in Gaulywood, where he functions as a kind of Gallic Jerry Bruckheimer ? There's little beyond the surface-deep pleasures of this talky distaff riff on Wings of Desire , although the raffish Debbouze and the gawky Rasmussen provide an ungainly sweetness. But the loony passion and profligate imagination of Besson's sci-fi whatsit The Fifth Element  are sorely missed.
