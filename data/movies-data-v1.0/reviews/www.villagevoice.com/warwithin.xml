      <text>One of the first of a presumed wave of movies that will attempt to convert our modern field of warring crusades&#151;Muslim terrorism and Western anti-terrorist hyper-security&#151;into mezzobrow entertainment, The War Within  follows in the introverted footsteps of Hassan (co-writer Ayad Akhtar ), a Pakistani wrongly imprisoned and tortured for terrorist affiliations. Whoever his victimizers were, they left him a dedicated suicide bomber, arriving in New York to stay with his childhood friend Sayeed (Firdous Bamji) and connect with a cell planning to blow up Grand Central Terminal .
The film's title may seem to spill the beans&#151;will the watchful Hassan carry out his mission or renege after enjoying America and flirting with Sayeed's ravishing sister (Nandana Sen)?&#151;but in fact, whatever inner conflict rages looks to us like moping and staring blankly out at the East River. (Time killed gazing from the beach or dock is a telltale sign of indie floundering.) Shot in DV by Lisa Rinzler, Joseph Castelo 's modest drama struggles for verisimilitude, but it wears clich√©s like concrete boots, down to the cycle-of-intolerance-and-violence message that we hear every day on NPR . Its low-budget conventionality makes something as risky as a two-shot rare, but the city is often richly captured. Certainly, there's little narrative urgency&#151;that is, until the final act, when the pretense to "war" is abandoned altogether, and Bamji, already the film's most genuine presence, slaps it awake with palpable moral outrage.
