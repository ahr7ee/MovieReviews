      <text>For the twin offenses of being French and not starring Tom Cruise , District B13 &#151;a fanboy mash-up of John Carpenter 's greatest hits, brought to you by the Luc Besson  laboratories&#151;is getting exiled to the art house ghetto. Spread the word: This delirious import is the most (maybe the only) fun action movie of the summer&#151;swift, funny, filled with actual stunts instead of digitized mayhem, and primed at a moment's notice for megaton ass-kicking. Set in 2010 Paris, it fuses Escape From New York 's futuristic city-as-prison concept with Assault on Precinct 13 's bristling political subtext, as an undercover cop (Cyril Raffaelli ) and a convict (David Belle ) battle their way through a walled-in underclass banlieue searching for a massive "clean bomb." The plot is mostly straight-to-video silliness, except for a final kicker that feeds off the real-life unrest seething in Paris's strife-torn suburbs. But Belle&#151;a master of parkour, the French extreme sport/martial art devoted to the casual hurdling of physical obstacles&#151;brings an exhilarating athleticism to the many chases and fights. I'd trade all of M:i:III 's 126 minutes for one 1.7-second shot of Belle hurtling himself in a single motion through a locked door's transom.
