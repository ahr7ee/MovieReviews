      <text>Anyone who never considered golf a hotbed of class conflict&#151;that is, pretty much everyone&#151;will be enlightened by The Greatest Game Ever Played , Bill Paxton 's adaptation of Mark Frost 's 2002 nonfiction bestseller. The story details the 1913 U.S. Open  rivalry between Yank amateur Francis Ouimet  (Shia LaBeouf ) and British pro Harry Vardon  (Stephen Dillane ), both of whom had working-class roots and battled golf's upper-crust gatekeepers for the right to play. Paxton gives Frost's screenplay the full Disney  polish, with squeaky-clean period detail and even cleaner divisions between the good-hearted plebs and conniving swells. But he also elicits open, nuanced performances from his cast (including the great Luke Askew ) and achieves a charged stillness that nicely conveys the self-combative isolation of athletic endeavors. That said, the CGI-enhanced links sequences are a jarring distraction, and the movie's overly detailed approach couldn't be more exhausting: Ouimet versus Vardon probably was the greatest golf game ever played, and Paxton and Frost do it justice, but I wouldn't sit through another simulated hole of it for Tiger Woods 's salary.
