      <text>Dude, that's not a regular zombie biting your neck, it's a Nazi  zombie! Which means that the flesh-eaters in Dead Snow  are better dressed than your typical George Romero  undead, and a lot more relentless. The unlucky travelers crossing paths with these swine are a modern-day group of medical students vacationing in the Norwegian Alps. A local tells them that, during World War II, a platoon of German soldiers was driven by the nearby townspeople into the mountains, never to be seen again. "There's an evil presence here," he warns, but, of course, the arrogant youths don't listen. For more than half of this 90-minute film, director Tommy Wirkola  plays things pretty straight—a mistake, perhaps, since the first half is pretty boring—but once the Nazi zombies start arriving en masse, he abruptly shifts to an Evil Dead –style zaniness, including the sight of a potential victim hanging off the side of a mountain while using a zombie's entrails as rope. Let's call this the gooiest movie of the year (so far).
