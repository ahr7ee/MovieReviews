      <text>No one can seem to think ill of regional humanist Victor Nuñez  (Ruby in Paradise , Ulee's Gold ), but this low-budget Florida old-schooler is generally half the storytelling powerhouse he is claimed to be and twice the amateurish cliché-monger. This, his latest film, sat undistributed for four years, despite a cast (Josh Brolin , Timothy Olyphant , Josh Lucas , Scott Wilson , William Forsythe ) that should have paid its way to a shelf at Blockbuster . Virtually everything about Coastlines , from its title to the scenario that tracks a laconic good old boy (Olyphant) as he returns from prison to his Gulf Coast swamp town and its still-tempting criminal backside, telegraphs the hand of an idea-free newbie, not three decades' experience crafting "personal" cinema. Brolin and Sarah Wynter , as the married woman swayed by the new boy in town, find a few genuine moments over a kitchen table, but Nuñez's script is a limping, obvious bore. For some fans, the taste of on-location color matters most, but Nuñez's idea of the characters' ordinariness translates to flavorlessness, and he lights and shoots his scenes with a high schooler's care, often not even bothering to match up sight lines. Merely going to Sopchoppy, Florida, with actors is not quite enough.
