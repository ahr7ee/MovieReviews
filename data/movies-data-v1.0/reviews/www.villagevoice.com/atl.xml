      <text>You may think you already know what it is: a cautionary 'hood-rap tale scarred by exit wounds and scored to booming basslines&#151;pop propaganda for the radio-ready soundtrack. But where lesser works have died trying, ATL  doesn't derive authenticity from criminality. Rather, it unpretentiously serves class consciousness and conflict with its Cadillac music, attempting to capture&#151;not capitalize on&#151;the Atlanta scene that's spawned an aesthetic and a mythology all its own, and is currently in full flourish. Music video vet Chris Robinson  distills a fine vintage from rich sources, namely his cast of (mostly) certified ATLiens who bring organic charisma to their character's interactions, playing them sweet like mash notes yet grown-ass as the men and women the tale's teens are trying to be. First and foremost is Tip Harris  (a/k/a T.I.), as a high school senior who spends his Sunday nights at a skate rink with his crew rather than adopt the dope boy lifestyle his younger bro aspires to. A debutant actor, T.I. seems equally at ease with his canny demeanor as with his mesmeric drawl, fluently swaggering between mellow and malicious from behind a winsome perma-squint. And as if channeling William Hurt 's latest villainous turn, Big Boi 's trapstar kingpin borders on self-parodic, delivering hilarious quips with bristling menace beneath. It's entertainment with ambition, but I can't front though; the soundtrack is pretty fly too.
