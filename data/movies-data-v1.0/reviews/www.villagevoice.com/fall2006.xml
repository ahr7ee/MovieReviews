Something like a pain-fueled, R-rated Princess Bride , The Fall  straddles the intertwined worlds of storytelling and story. One half is a child&#146;s-eye-view tour of the convalescent wing of a Los Angeles hospital, set during the infancy of the film industry. Heartbroken-to-the-brink-of-suicide stuntman Roy (Lee Pace ) finds himself fabricating a tale about a band of brethren brigands to entertain a recuperating nine-year-old girl (Catinca Untaru , so adorable that I vacillated between feeling saccharine-sick and wanting to adopt her). The other half of the film involves the girl&#146;s visualization of this improvised bedtime story, as the multinational, one-dimensional bandits sally forth in billowing slo-mo on an epic journey to topple a tyrannical governor. As Roy&#146;s depression deepens, the story darkens accordingly. Director Tarsem, a commercial-shoot hired gun whose first and last feature until now was 2000&#146;s The Cell , grabbed vistas for his bloviated pictorialist fantasia on cross-continental on-location shoots, pulling together a supersaturated, border-blurring National Geographic  travelogue of steppes, deserts, and Ottoman extravagance (the director&#146;s Indian origins gives the movie&#146;s references to Orientalism an interesting twist). If the human details are often problematic, the IMAX-grade bombast, ceremonial camera, and Jodorowsky-esque eclecticism still combine for a singular spectacle.
