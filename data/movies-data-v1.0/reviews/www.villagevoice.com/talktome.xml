      <text>Having ascended to genre supremacy, the biopic has long since reached its imaginative low&#151;so much so that the banality of Talk To Me  is only half disappointing; at least it babbles clich√©s with conviction. Directed by Kasi Lemmons  (Eve's Bayou ) from a screenplay by Michael Genet  and Rick Famuyiwa , this earnest, ineffectual history lesson stars Don Cheadle  as Ralph Waldo "Petey" Green, an ex-con turned Washington, D.C., radio phenomenon who electrified Chocolate City in the 1960s with his streetwise populism. Chiwetel Ejiofor  co-stars as Dewey Hughes , a sympathetic producer at the complacent soul station WOL-AM; Martin Sheen  appears as The Man. Textured by ego trips, boozing, red velvet tuxedos, and a soundtrack jammed with rousing, if predictable hits of the era, Talk To Me lacks every kind of specificity (historical, psychological, socio-cultural) but redeems itself through the dedication of its Cheadlicious lead. As in the overrated Hotel Rwanda , Cheadle is a live wire in dead air, shimmering with vitality&#151;and silk paisley blouses&#151;against his oppressively formulaic context.
