      <text>Where most other Adult Swim  shows are nothing but snarked-up jalopies salvaged from the Hanna-Barbera  junkyard, ATHF exists in its own little world populated by Frylock (voiced by Carey Means ), a blaxploitation box of fries; Master Shake (Dana Snyder ), who is indeed no smarter than your average dairy product; and Meatwad (Willis), who, with his ability to take the shape of myriad meat products, might reasonably be described as "cute" were he not also covered in hair. The trio's big-screen debut features an exercise machine sent from the future to destroy the planet, and an origin story involving the Sphinx, Abraham Lincoln , and the FBI . But narrative's beside the point in a movie created by two guys who gorge on pop culture's high-fat diet and regurgitate it into something approaching . . . art? Close enough.
