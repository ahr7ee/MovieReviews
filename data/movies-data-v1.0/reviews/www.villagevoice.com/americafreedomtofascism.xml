      <text>It's a little disingenuous for filmmaker Aaron Russo  to pose as just an uninformed individual trying to uncover the "truth" about the IRS  in this new documentary&#151;he doesn't tell you that he ran in the Libertarian Party's presidential primary in 2004, and his mind was made up a long time ago. Nonetheless, his arguments about the constitutionality of the federal income tax deserve a serious point-by-point response from someone in the know. Even though Russo seems to be arguing a technicality&#151; the Sixteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to tax income, but no law since has explicitly laid out how they should do it&#151;the government ought to answer better than they have. Unfortunately, that's not the whole movie. From the tax debate, the documentary suddenly gets scattershot, going after the Patriot Act , laws against vitamin sales, election fraud, and Hurricane Katrina  response (apparently a plot to grab people's guns), building to the standard New World Order line, which discredits any valid points Russo may have.
