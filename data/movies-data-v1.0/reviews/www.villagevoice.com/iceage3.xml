      <text>Though hardly landmarks of narrative or animation art, the first two Ice Ages  were warm and goofy and appealing; John Leguizamo 's adorably sibilant Sid the Sloth remains a much-quoted guy in our household. But as with Shrek  and countless other over-extended studio franchises, the well has run bone-dry. Part Three sends woolly mammoths Manny (Ray Romano ), a very pregnant Ellie (Queen Latifah ), and the rest of their cobbled-together family of misfits to a lush land below the ice that's fraught with dangers&#151;like a burping purple plant that ingests foreigners&#151;and teeming with the endlessly marketable dinosaurs so carelessly dispatched in the first movie. However spuriously gussied-up with 3-D, this verdant underworld is a playground for animation geeks, but its narrative pull hovers around zero, unless you count the lame post-millennial jokes about helicopter parents and single dads doubling as single moms, and even those are nothing but an excuse to float a raft of cuddly prehistoric babies for audience tots and their elders to coo over. Even with the addition of an (obligatory Cockney) weasel (Simon Pegg ) to steer the herd through the usual slalom ride of hot lava and hostile beasties, there's no breathing life into a formula that ought to have bowed out gracefully while the going was good.
