      <text>By dawn at the latest, as per the title, Lucille (Ashley Judd ) will squeeze back into her jeans and flee another stranger's house, the screw-'em-and-split routine having something to do with her emotionally unavailable dad (Scott Wilson ). But she never counted on hooking up with Cal (Jeffrey Donovan ), a very, very  nice guy who lends a slow hand in turning their one-night stand into a week-long recline. Judd's typically lived-in performance and the authentic Arkansas locations&#151;cramped bars, dusty roads&#151;help vaguely distinguish a movie that comes on like a minor-key reprise of Judd's breakthrough Ruby in Paradise  and every other rural indie melodrama to grace Sundance since.
