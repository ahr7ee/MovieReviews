      <text>Twelve-year-olds might get a charge out of this purportedly daring documentary celebration of the F-word, although it never occurs to filmmaker Steve Anderson  that it might be fun or even genuinely lewd to interview kids on the subject. Instead he grants screen time to a predicable roster of pro-obscenity celebs&#151;Janeane Garofalo , Ice-T , Bill Maher , the late Hunter S. Thompson &#151;as well as some senior admirers of the expletive such as (newsflash! ) ABC's alarming Sam Donaldson . Other talking heads, one or two of them with Ph.D.'s, bid to make the doc sociological, but aside from the historically worthy identification of General George S. Patton  as a pioneering potty mouth, the film contains little or nothing in the way of surprise.
