      <text>In this decidedly amoral thriller, Vera Farmiga  gives a jittery, complex performance as Kate, a high-strung Connecticut mother of two who has a breakdown after losing her third child in labor. Despite the fact that she is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for less than a year, and despite the fact that she nearly let her son drown when she was drunk, Kate and her rich architect husband (Peter Sarsgaard ) easily win permission to adopt a replacement child. Enter nine-year-old Esther (well-played by 11-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman ), a Russian-born beauty whose sweet exterior hides devilish intent. Soon, Esther is doing away with her perceived enemies, a process that includes death-by-hammer and death-by-carving-knife. If director Jaume Collet-Serra  (House of Wax ), screenwriter David Leslie Johnson , and their big-time co-producers, Joel Silver  and Leonardo DiCaprio , have any qualms about explicitly showing a little girl slaughtering people or attempting to seduce a grown man or pointing a gun at the head of her six-year-old stepsister (the wonderful Aryana Engineer), they have clearly worked through them (as have, apparently, the young actor&#146;s respective parents). Silly, overlong, and bloody as hell, Orphan  is likely to turn a sweet profit, money that Leo, the renowned do-gooder, should spend with shame.
