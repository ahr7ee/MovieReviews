      <text>Another videogame spinoff, this mindless horror flick directed by Christophe Gans  (Brotherhood of the Wolf ) replays the clich√© of the desperate parent searching for a lost child. In this case, a dim-witted mother (Radha Mitchell ) tempts fate by driving her troubled daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland ), to the menacing, fog-shrouded old mining town whose name keeps recurring in the girl's nightmares. The kid promptly vanishes and&#151;right on cue&#151;assorted ghouls, fiends, and monsters begin popping out of the woodwork to scare the bejesus out of Mom. Stuffed with cheap effects and devoid of tension, this French-Japanese-U.S. co-production contributes exactly zilch to the rich film history of those three nations; the most horror-crazed teen may be hard-pressed to find any authentic thrills here. With Sean Bean  as the distressed father and Alice Krige  as Silent Hill 's resident religious nutjob. Pulp Fiction  co-writer Roger Avary  is responsible for the murky screenplay.
