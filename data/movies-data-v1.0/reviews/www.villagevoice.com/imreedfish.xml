      <text>Short of pulling a Zach Braff , there's one sure way to get known as a screenwriter: Put your actual name in the title of the script. Add a bunch of indie bands, find a Braff look-alike (Jay Baruchel ) to play the lead, top it off with some obscure animal hybrid&#151;a zorse instead of a liger&#151;and you've got writer Reed Fish 's can't-fail debut. The semi- fictional character Fish, with both parents dead in a car accident, looks set to follow in his father's footsteps: take over the small-town radio show&#151;"the voice of Mud Meadows"&#151;that his dad hosted for years, marry the local hottie (Alexis Bledel ), and settle in to a life of babymaking, bowling, and Dance Dance Revolution . But wait! Cue the old high school flame (Schuyler Fisk ), back from college and casting her indie-folk spell to "hook the Fish." And just so you know this Fish has got chops, there's a flashy Brechtian film-within-a-film conceit, showing Fish (still played by Baruchel) making his film and even, for a moment, substituting his real girlfriends (or are they?!?) for their on-screen doubles. Because irony fixes everything.
