      <text>Go  and Charlie's Angels  screenwriter John August  wrote and directed this solipsistic, sub&#150;Charlie Kaufman  head-trip about a washed-up cop-show actor confined to house arrest, a gay TV writer battling the network over his latest pilot, and a successful video-game designer whose family holiday turns sinister after his car breaks down in the woods. The catch is that the characters (all played by Ryan Reynolds ) are versions&#151;or fragments&#151;of the same person, and as the successive storylines play out, it's clear that August is trying to show us the inner workings of a writer's mind. It's hardly a novel idea, but at least when Kaufman, David Lynch , or Michel Gondry  invites us on a tour of his chaotic subconscious, it's a fascinating place to visit. Plunging into August's gray matter is more like a season in vacation hell. The film's first section, in which Reynolds's vain sex symbol hooks up with his married neighbor (Hope Davis ), plays like outtakes from a low-rent porno; the middle section suggests a wan retread of The TV Set ; and the grand finale&#151;which we understand to be the troubled pilot itself&#151;quickly qualifies as must-not-see TV. Each time around, Reynolds is haunted in some way by the titular numeral, a feeling likely to be shared by anyone who spends about that many dollars on a ticket.
