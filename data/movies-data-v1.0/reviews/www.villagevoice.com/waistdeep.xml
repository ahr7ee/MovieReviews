      <text>Vondie Curtis Hall 's irrational and contradictory crime thriller stars Tyrese Gibson  (2 Fast 2 Furious ) as an indestructible ex-con who, with a sullen but sizzling L.A. streetwalker (Meagan Good ), sets out to find his kidnapped son. They raise ransom money on a well-publicized 24-hour crime spree and put two rival street gangs to rout in the process. Supposedly a contemporary Bonnie and Clyde , this is really a tacit endorsement of greedy gangsta life vaguely disguised within a morality play: The Hummers and the heavy artillery of the hip-hopping bad guys look like glossy magazine ads. For its ever shifting attitudes toward men, women, and murder, Waist Deep  is one of the sloppiest movies ever to reach the screen. With rapper the Game  as a one-eyed gang kingpin called Big Meat, whose specialty is chopping arms off disloyal underlings.
