Ten years ago, the notion of a science-fantasy rendition of Romeo and Juliet  starring Freddie Prinze Jr.  and Jennifer Love Hewitt  might have seemed like a sure-fire moneymaker, and the level of CG animation in Delgo  might also have looked state-of-the-art. Today, few are likely to pay much attention, despite a voice cast that also includes Malcolm McDowell , Michael Clarke Duncan , Val Kilmer , Anne Bancroft , Eric Idle , Burt Reynolds , Louis Gossett Jr.  . . . oh, and Kelly Ripa  and Chris Kattan , alas. Set in a land called Jhamora, Delgo  tells the tale of two races hoping to live in peace, yet set on the brink of war. One is a race of reptile-people who can move stones with their minds; the other, winged sprites who ride dragons (which seems redundant). All appear to have exactly the same face: a leftover Gelfling mask from The Dark Crystal  that simply gets re-colored ad infinitum. When fairy-like Princess Kyla (Hewitt) saves the life of saurian dork Delgo (Prinze), the two stumble onto a conspiracy by an exiled queen (Bancroft) and treacherous general (McDowell) to conquer both races. Will love save the day? You won't careâ€”more likely, you'll just wonder why this isn't a video game you can actually play.
