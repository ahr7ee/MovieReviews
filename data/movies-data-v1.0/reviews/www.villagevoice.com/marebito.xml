      <text>Helmed by the J-horror hotshot behind the Ju-on  films (and their Yankee Grudge  remakes), and starring Tetsuo  auteur Shinya Tsukamoto , this all-digital indie is, by genre standards, either a misfired doodle or an attempt to Lovecraft-ize the popular movement. Or both. Tsukamoto's shutterbug loner, his flat a mad tangle of video and surveillance equipment, is obsessed with fear&#151;not unlike an entire generation of Asian filmmakers and viewers. He hunts it down in the Tokyo streets, studies photographs of suicides, thinks of it in unconvincingly abstract terms&#151;until he finds a nondescript door in the subway and enters a secret underworld that eventually opens up into a cavernous fantasy realm. There he finds a naked, gray-skinned girl in chains, and decides to bring her back to reality.
Then our hero must attempt to acclimatize the gamine to modern-day Japan , or at least to his apartment, but she sleeps all the time, drinks blood, and says nothing. Anyone with college-age children can sympathize, but Marebito  is more contemplative (albeit of nonsensical issues) than frightening, and little about it suggests that Shimizu  even had a script written before he began shooting. For a tasty pulp myth about "fear," turn to William Castle 's The Tingler .
