      <text>There was every reason going in to believe that 1408 , based on a Stephen King  short story, would be nothing but a Shining  rip-off made on the cheap. The screenwriters are collectively responsible for Reign of Fire , Problem Child 3 ,  and Agent Cody Banks  ; John Cusack  has proven he's not above taking a gig for the paycheck; and director Mikael H sole English-language film was the dreadful Derailed . Yet it's a surprisingly effective movie. Cusack plays a former novelist who, after the death of his daughter, abandons all interest in the living to focus on the dead, writing travel guides with titles like 10 Haunted Hotels . But in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel  in Manhattan, he finds his first truly "evil fucking room." The horror wouldn't work without Cusack, who makes what could have been a rote acting exercise&#151;Be tough! Now angry! Now defensively funny! &#151;a cathartic ritual instead.
