      <text>An ugly-duckling fable populated with grotesques out of John Waters , Pizza  attempts an unlikely mode: earnest camp. Obese, bespectacled, and painfully sure of herself, Cara-Ethyl (Kylie Sparks ) is a kindred spirit to Todd Solondz 's Dawn Wiener , plus a helium voice and minus self-consciousness. Every phrase she utters seems deliberately mangled. She's turning 18 "at the cock's crow," but naturally, only her imaginary friend has shown up to the party. Out of the blue, a pizza deliveryman (Ethan Embry ) invites Cara-Ethyl to ride shotgun on his rounds. Is this guy a pedophile? A saint? An all-around cool dude with time to spare and a van to show off? Their trip constitutes a cross section of suburbia as previously conceived by Lynch, K. Smith, and Gallo: slovenly roommates, a handicapped Irishwoman, an unbalanced drama teacher, and the local Heathers&#151;none served well by the slapdash DV, perhaps director Mark Christopher 's penance for the disco glitz of 54 . What all this mannered jabbering adds up to is unclear, though one inarguable moral is that pizza tastes good. Forget 30-minute delivery&#151;this brand of indie quirkiness congealed in the late '90s.
