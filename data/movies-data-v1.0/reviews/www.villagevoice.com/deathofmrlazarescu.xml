      <text>CANNES , FRANCE&#151; Longer on comebacks than discoveries, Cannes 2005 nevertheless struck gold with The Death of Mr. Lazarescu , the second feature by Cristi Puiu , a 38-year-old Romanian ex-painter. The Death of Mr. Lazarescu &#151;awarded the prize of the "Un Certain Regard" section&#151;is an explicit ode to mortality, not without a certain grim humor. An old drunk awakes with a headache&#151;or is it stomach pain? After a day of self-medication, he calls 911. The ambulance takes over 30 minutes (film time) to arrive, and from the limbo of his squalid flat, Lazarescu enters hell&#151;transported from hospital to hospital for the movie's remaining two hours, variously diagnosed, browbeaten, and ignored by a harried succession of brilliantly acted doctors and nurses. His characters constantly talking and his camera in near-continual motion, Puiu simulates the institutional texture of a Frederick Wiseman  vérité. The inspiration, he says, was Eric Rohmer  and ER : "When you watch the American TV series, there's movement in every direction, the choreography of the characters is amazing. . . . In my country, doctors and everyone else live in slow motion, as if they were on Valium , and still had 500 years to live." And that's even more remarkable.
