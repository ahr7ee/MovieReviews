      <text>In honor of Dutch provocateur Theo van Gogh —who was murdered in 2004 by an Islamic extremist, angered by one of his films—Van Gogh's producers initiated an English-language trilogy of remakes based on his early two-handers. Steve Buscemi 's Interview  was canned and limp. Next at bat is director and star Stanley Tucci 's Blind Date , which similarly suffers from the restrictions of the project (it's overly faithful to the original and to Van Gogh's preferred three-camera setup). Tucci and Patricia Clarkson  share a bruised chemistry as an estranged couple bound by grief and anger over the death of their young daughter. In a bizarre ritual more torturous than cathartic (insert Antichrist  joke here), the two meet regularly at Tucci's dingy cabaret and role-play blind dates, their improvised characters admitting painful truths in the margins of conversation each night. Co-adapted by Tucci and Interview 's David Schechter , the dialogue isn't nearly as slippery as the stop-on-a-dime spins between melancholy, misanthropy, and disarming humor in Clarkson and Tucci's deliveries—but the actors chase the text like a chew toy anyway. Stagey pacing and unnecessary magic-realist voiceover aside, the film's ultimate failure as moving melodrama is that we experience these two acting as a dance partner, a reporter—even a blind man—but we never get who they really are, beyond grieving parents.
