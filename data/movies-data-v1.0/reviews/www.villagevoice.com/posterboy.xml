      <text>Henry Kray  is a gay student at a fictional private college in New York. His freedom to be as miserably self-involved and openly sexually active as his peers is curtailed by his father's position: Republican senator from North Carolina. When the senator asks his son to step up to the campaign podium on his behalf, the closeted Henry has a crisis of conscience, and his father's PR charade begins to break down. Poster Boy 's frame, in which Henry spills the details of the scandal to a self-interested reporter, reeks of contrivance. And the drama that fills the flashbacks is painfully hyperbolized. Despite the screenwriters' attempts to make him sympathetic, Henry is surly and coy, so we don't care whether he escapes his father's heartless machine. Rather than creating believable characters engaged in nuanced conflict, Boy  proffers a pair of obvious symbols and hopes that they'll make a statement about the personal and the political.
