      <text>Our stinky ogre grows flabbier by the sequel, and this time around we find him reeling from the death of his froggy father-in-law and the prospect of running the kingdom of Far Far Away in his stead. What to do in the face of such crisis but take to the road with Donkey and Puss In Boots while shoehorning in a new character (voiced by Justin Timberlake ) designed to drag the middle-school demographic away from its iPods  and into the multiplex? Bolstered by fart jokes, mass- marketing, and the usual flood of tie-ins, Shrek  the Third  will surely take in its usual bundle at the box office, but that doesn't make the movie a success. Blinded by avarice and all out of ideas, once again, Hollywood  can't tell when enough is way more than enough.
