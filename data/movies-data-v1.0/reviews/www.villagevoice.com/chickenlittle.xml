      <text>In its first computer-animated feature without Pixar , Disney  shirks the wit of Toy Story 2  and Monsters, Inc.  in favor of the blandness of Saturday-morning cartoons. Of course, as every babbling-stage child knows, the story of the world's most famous avian alarmist shouldn't take 78 minutes to tell. Disney distends it into an exercise in talk-to-your-dad-ism, casting Chicken Little (Zach Braff ) as a nerdy runt of a bird who loses the confidence of his father (Garry Marshall ) after causing a town-wide panic by claiming that the sky is falling. One year later, his humiliation compounded by the imminent release of Crazy Little Chicken: The Movie , Chicken can't catch a break in school&#151;he's stuck with an unconscionably high locker, perennially relegated to the "unpopular" dodgeball team, and consistently late to sheep-speak class (every answer is "baa"). The usual pop-culture jokes, disco tunes, and sarcastic narrator are on hand to prevent atrophy, but by the time the sky really does start "falling"&#151;courtesy of an alien invasion&#151; Chicken Little 's frantic efforts to stay farm fresh have started to wear on the nerves.
