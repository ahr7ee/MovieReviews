Directed by Peter Cattaneo , The Rocker 's more or less the Pete Best Story —the tale of a poor bastard who gets shitcanned right on the brink of record-bin immortality. The film opens in Cleveland, mid-1980s, where Rainn Wilson 's Robert "Fish" Fishman is behind the kit for Vesuvius , a metal band fronted by three head-bobbing, hair-waving morons (Will Arnett , Fred Armisen , and Bradley Cooper ) whose loyalty only extends to the dotted line. Told to either ditch their drummer or lose a deal with a record label, his bandmates choose the former, sending Fish into a tailspin from which he never recovers. Until decades later, that is, when he falls in with A.D.D., the high-school band for which his portly, pale nephew (Josh Gad ) plays keyboard. Fish wins over the sulking, songwriting frontman (Teddy Geiger ) and the brooding, scowling guitarist (Emma Stone ), and they're signed and touring and sell-out famous within hours of making their inauspicious Interwebs debut. Sooner or later, they're forced to choose between opening for Vesuvius or busting up the band. A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers  sitcom on the Disney Channel , The Rocker  comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasn't bought music since it was sold "on records," or ever met a music executive who wasn't a character in This Is Spinal Tap  . This is sugary-sweet stuff—pop instead of rock.
