      <text>Writer Steve Niles  and illustrator Ben Templesmith 's three-issue comic-book series, originally published in 2002, spawned a subsequent franchise and now a big-screen adaptation by doing little more than drenching the centuries-old vampire myth in just a little more gore&#151;something for the kids. Director David Slade 's stab at the story is actually rather ordinary: a grisly game of hide-and-seek, pitting the town's few survivors (among them Josh Hartnett  as the sheriff and Melissa George  as his estranged wife) against the bloodsucking gang, led by Danny Huston , who speaks in a foreign tongue just for extra spookiness. The promise of endless night is misleading; they should have called this 30 Days for Night , as the thing's as brightly lit as any MGM musical, despite the power being out all over town. Alas, that's just a nitpicky point&#151;there are much larger problems, chief among them being that the movie's just not very scary. And perhaps that's the point: It's as much a western as it is a horror film, with Harnett as Will Kane and Huston's posse as the evildoers come to do him in. Get it? High Noon , when it's always midnight. Shrug. Still, it's the best thing Hartnett's ever done; the guy's better at playing the undead . . . no surprise there.
