      <text>Exactly the sort of coy, patronizing pap you'd imagine actors like Kristin Scott Thomas  and Maggie Smith  take merely to pay debts or mortgages, Keeping Mum  involves a country vicar (Rowan Atkinson ), his sexually frustrated wife (Thomas), and a dotty busybody maid (Smith) who seems to solve the family's various problems with just a twinkle of her watery eye. If the exquisite, heather-thatch -and-old-churchyard village ambience doesn't assail your blood sugar, Dickon Hinchliffe 's nonstop, abusively rosy-cheeked soundtrack will. But we know thanks to an opening flashback that Smith's coot is actually a quiet sociopathic husband-killer, and the bodies begin to primly drop. (One of them, thank Christ, is Patrick Swayze , as a seductive-lech golf pro jeopardizing the family's struggling equilibrium.) Obvious, simplistic, and never funny, Johnson's movie may be useful only as real estate porn&#151;Cornwall  and the Isle of Man  never looked so super cute. Michael Atkinson
