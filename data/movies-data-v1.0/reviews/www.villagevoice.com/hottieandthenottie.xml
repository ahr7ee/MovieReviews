      <text>Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny, The Hottie and the Nottie  stars Paris Hilton  as . . . But really, need I go on? [Ed.: A little, yes. ] OK, fine: Hilton stars as monosyllabic event-planner Cristabelle Abbott, "the hottest woman in Los Angeles" and absurd object of desire for Nate Cooper  (Joel David Moore ), an unemployed, unsympathetic asshole. Scripted by Heidi Ferrer  and shat onscreen by director Tom Putnam , this strong contender for The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen follows Nate's attempt to woo the "hottie" while suffering the rancid foot fungus, oozing facial blisters, and hideous tooth decay of her best friend, June Phigg (Christine Lakin ). Which leads to such hilarious antics as the yoga-class mishap in which Nate, inching his nose into Cristabel's downward- dogging, spandex-clad ass, gets a whiff of Phiggian foot funk instead. Guffaw! Bonus point for Hilton's straight-faced delivery of the sentence: "Do you think I'm  a pod person?" Unfortunately, I'll have to take it right back for the inclusion of Randy, a retarded albino stalker.
