      <text>Don Imus 's 2007 remarks about "nappy-headed hos" underscored the immense fear of and fascination with the hair follicles of African-American women. Chris Rock , the host, co-writer, and co-producer of first-time director Jeff Stilson 's Good Hair , never mentions Imus's outburst; his interest in the political, social, and sexual entanglements of the tonsorial stems from the more personal—specifically, when one of his two young daughters plaintively asked, "Daddy, how come I don't have good hair?" Rock, affable as ever, queries a few black actresses (Nia Long  providing the most candid responses: "Weave sex is a little awkward"); visits beauty salons; oversees an experiment by a scientist who demonstrates the corrosive effects of sodium hydroxide, the main ingredient in hair relaxer; travels to Chennai , India, where women sacrifice hair that ends up in weaves costing thousands of dollars in the U.S.; and stares in disbelief at the Paris Is Burning –like competition at the annual Bronner Bros. –sponsored International Hair Show in Atlanta. Rock is certainly a sympathetic and curious observer, though including Ice-T 's remark that "a real pimp can tell what a woman looks like baldheaded" betrays some of the gender politics that remain vigorously unexamined in this breezy, superficial doc.
