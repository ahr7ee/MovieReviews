      <text>Ah, January, hallowed dustbin for projects half-baked, too-cooked, or both, as in the case of this overstuffed noir actioner from Korean-American newcomer Jieho Lee . Nothing if not ambitious, this muddled omnibus of zealously interlocked parables of love and death&#151;inspired by an ancient Chinese proverb&#151;suffers from a surfeit of noir influences, glum existential aper√ßus, and bodies going thwack  on windshields. Lee and co-writer Bob DeRosa  show more taste than respect for their top-drawer actors: Forest Whitaker , grimacing haplessly as a nerdy banker risking all for naught; Brendan Fraser , trying to look world-weary while not collapsing into giggles as a woolly-capped hit man burdened with humanitarian impulses, a sad past, and an unhelpful ability to see the future; Sarah Michelle Gellar , a troubled pop star trapped under the thumb of gangster Andy Garcia ; and Kevin Bacon  in saint mode, risking all for the love of an unaccountably droopy Julie Delpy . The destiny-versus- responsibility hand-wringing is Philosophy 101, the camera angles straight out of film school, and the pacing strictly music-video. Plus, the ta-da! twist ending is foreshadowed roughly 20 minutes into the action, for those still interested. Lee has talent, intelligence, and something to say&#151;if only someone had thought to stop him from packing in every film he ever wanted to make under one roof.
