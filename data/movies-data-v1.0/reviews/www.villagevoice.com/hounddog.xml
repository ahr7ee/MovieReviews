Having lurched through a gantlet of Sundance jeers, recuts, and release delays, writer/director Deborah Kampmeier 's Hounddog —at least as far as the press notes indicate (urgently)—now exists as a version different from the one that met such derision. One imagines, however, that the song—both the hip-swiveler of the title and the Southern Gothic story of FUBAR families, innocence, and, yes, child rape that it brackets—remains more or less the same. Dakota Fanning  plays 12-year-old Lewellen, and while the role will test the patience of even the staunchest survival-parable lovers, Fanning's extraordinary poise finally trumps precocity. "I'm gonna kill my daddy one day," she declares in the first scene, and why not? Played by David Morse , he's an inconstant brute with a wardrobe full of wife-beaters, in case there was any doubt. The symbolism is as clobbering as the blows that send Lewellen's maybe-mommy (Robin Wright Penn ) reeling: Snakes abound, notably in a grotesque, crotch-slithering dream sequence. Shot in mellow green and gold, Hounddog  manages an engaging summer sweetness in its early scenes, as Lewellen plots to obtain a ticket to a local Elvis  concert, but in the wake of the inadvertent betrayal that leads to her now-notorious rape (a sequence that, ironically, seems to have lost the horrific impact it needs), the film turns listless. By the time Lewellen gets tutored in the white-girl blues by a band of magical Negroes, it has fulfilled its risible potential.
