      <text>A rather beautifully produced indie mix of melodrama, ethnographic detail, and modern Southern gothic, The King begins with a symbolic recipe Don McLean  might find shaky: a Corpus Christi  evangelist with a secret (William Hurt ), plus a wild-eyed, navy-fresh kid named Elvis who might be his illegit son (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal ), plus loads of suggestions about gardens, snakes, and blood-soaked sin. Brit director James Marsh  evidently has a touristy yen for lowdown Americana&#151;two of his earlier documentaries were Wisconsin Death Trip  and The Burger &amp; the King: The Life &amp; Cuisine of Elvis Presley  . Be that as it may, and despite a story that's as lackadaisical as it is programmatic, The King  has a hypnotically naturalist vibe, from the Jesus-clean Lone Star suburbs and low-rent, uncaricatured preachifying to the fall of afternoon light through old house windows and onto a teenager's skin. Bernal's weaselly nowhere man insinuates himself into Hurt's disciplined family and between the legs of its pubescent daughter (Pell James ), giving the localized action a dose of ancient-Greek octane.
The film survives on a thick diet of genuine acting moments. Bernal, as the Grand Guignol catalyst, plays it with the nearly hidden wariness of a sociopath, but it's impossible not to believe Paul Dano  as the family's pale, earnest scion/minister-to-be and James as the vulnerable girl among bow hunters whose job it is to swab up the deer guts. Best of all, Hurt expands on a great American archetype&#151;the neocon mega-dad who's on a mission but lost, holy but poisoned from within, macho but never very sure of what's right. Probably no other actor standing today could've brought this much juice to such a potentially simplistic character.
