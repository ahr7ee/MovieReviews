      <text>You think they're dead, these zombie-film parodies, but, one after another, they keep lumbering back. Not much brain activity, alas, in this Canadian indie, which rather non-hilariously dispatches its walking corpses to '50s suburbia, where they're put to work as domestic servants and gardeners. For anyone who hasn't pictured the movie's 91 minutes already: In sunny Willard, docile, gray-faced zombies carry golf clubs and duly provide target practice for Red Scare&#150;era schoolkids, until a particularly ravenous ghoul takes a chunk out of old Mrs. Henderson's fleshy arm. Within 20 minutes, Vancouver -based writer-director Andrew Currie  leads us to stop expecting actual jokes while squandering the talents of an overqualified cast that includes Dylan Baker  and Carrie-Anne Moss  as the film's Ward and June Cleaver , and Scottish actor Billy Connolly  as the titular zombie-cum-pet and loyal pal of the couple's young son (K'Sun Ray ). The movie's Pleasantville  sets are well designed on a slim budget, but the '50s-style restraint extends to Currie's tame direction and generally makes a zombie-lover hungry for the real deal Ã  la 28 Weeks Later &#151;which was still taking a bite out of the box office at last check.
