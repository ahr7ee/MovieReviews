      <text>At long last love: Kutcher and Peet take forever to connect
A Lot Like Love  exemplifies the happiness-deferred romance, in which two friends-but-should-be-paramours repeatedly convene, separate, and reconvene over several years, finally staying together only after feature run-time has elapsed. Skimming through lonely stretches and careerist angst, the movie focuses on incidents that threaten the final hookup. But the chemistry between diaper salesman Ashton Kutcher  and photo hound Amanda Peet  is so off that the pairing scans as an alienation effect&#151;one enhanced by their age difference, as well as Peet's resemblance (in her goth, graduate-age New York scenes) to an unwaxed Demi Moore . The banter soon develops a rhythm: Hurting from a breakup, Peet gets too drunk to nuzzle and Kutcher doesn't complain; years later, on a car trip, Kutcher whines about his ex and Peet shrugs it off. Interjections from perennial second bananas Kathryn Hahn  (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ) and Kal Penn  (winning even when not conjuring vivified bags of pot) generate the only sparks.
