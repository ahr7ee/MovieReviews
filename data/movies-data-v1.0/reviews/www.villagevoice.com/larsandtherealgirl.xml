      <text>How painful to watch Ryan Gosling , one of the most elastic actors of his generation, smirk and gawp and grimace his way through Craig Gillespie 's smarmy little number about a pudgy Midwestern office drudge so terrified of human contact that the only, um, person he can bond with is a mail-order Brazilian sex doll. Lurking within the high concept is a Triggering Trauma so wasting (and banal) that it takes not only loving relatives (Paul Schneider  and Emily Mortimer ) but a whole village of empathic Scandinavian stoics to sort him out, steered by a therapist played by Patricia Clarkson , giving her dry best shot to hoary old bromides like "It's not a mental illness, it's a form of communication." In fact, as Six Feet Under   writer Nancy Oliver  ought to know, barking mad might have made a movie. Instead, Lars and the Real Girl  wobbles in a slow, toneless no-man's-land between mawkish and schmaltzy while trafficking shamelessly in heartland stereotypy.
