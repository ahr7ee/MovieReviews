      <text>Toshio, that malicious, pale little boy from The Grudge, will follow you home with his pissed-off mother in tow and maybe rip your jaw off. Ringu 's watery witch Sadako will reach out from your TV set and paralyze you with her stare of doom. Megumi (Megumi Okina ), the roving angry spirit at the center of Shutter , will shoot you icy looks from afar and ruin your wedding photos. Oh, and give you a shoulder cramp. Scared yet? Jane Shaw  (Rachael Taylor , the blonde-bombshell hacker from Transformers ) sure is&#151;so terrified that she occasionally forgets she&#146;s supposed to have an American accent. And yet, if the ghost never actually hurts her, why should we care? A newlywed in Japan  alongside jet-setting photographer hubby Ben (Joshua Jackson ), Jane first encounters Megumi on a lonely country road, and in several visions and blurred photos thereafter . . . but nothing really happens until about an hour into the movie, by which point it isn&#146;t long before the inevitable series of fake-out endings and obvious &#147;twists&#148; kick in. Ostensibly a remake of a Thai film&#151;by a Japanese director with a Hollywood  cast&#151;this plays more like a video copy of The Ring  that&#146;s been so degraded that all the good bits are no longer visible.
