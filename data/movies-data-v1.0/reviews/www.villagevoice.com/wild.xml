      <text>"It's not Pixar " is becoming the mantra of parents who dutifully shlep their tots to each new 3-D animated feature, and Disney 's latest entry won't silence them. The premise combines a largely laugh-free variation on Madagascar   with a landlocked Finding Nemo  emotional arc: A domesticated daddy lion (voice of Kiefer Sutherland ) confronts his own parenting issues when his sulky cub (Greg Cipes ) is accidentally shipped from the New York Zoo to Africa. Along with Sutherland, reduced to directing his patented Jack Bauer  bellow at a gassy cartoon hyrax, the voice cast includes Eddie Izzard , Janeane Garofalo , and William Shatner , but there's not a spark of chemistry among them. Which is too bad: They're the only personality the bland character designs have. Under Steve "Spaz" Williams' direction, the animation is exquisitely detailed, down to the lions' individually moving whiskers&#151;but when's the last time you enjoyed a cartoon for its realism?
