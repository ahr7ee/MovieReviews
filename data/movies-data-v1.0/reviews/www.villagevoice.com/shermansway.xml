Director Craig Saavedra  and writer Tom Nance 's collaboration plays like something out of an indie-film paint-by-numbers. Take a richie-rich, straight-laced stuffed-shirt (Michael Shulman  as set-for-life college student Sherman ), stick him in a beat-up roadster heading cross-country that's piloted by a wacky wash-up (James LeGros  as forgotten Winter Olympian Palmer "The Bomber"), toss in a few eccentrics and hotties-to-trot along the way, and, voila, off to the film festival circuit we shall go in search of shallow-end enlightenment. The acting doesn't help—just how many cue cards were used in this production, anyhow? And, though no fault of its own, the film now feels like a rinky-dink redo of HBO 's new Eastbound &amp; Down  series, starring Danny McBride  in more or less the same role as LeGros—the former star athlete who thinks he's big shit but is nothing more than a dumb shit on his way to the footnotes.
