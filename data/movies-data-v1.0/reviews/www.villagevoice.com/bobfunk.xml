      <text>Movies-especially inconsequential, earnest comedies like Bob Funk   about how people "achieved" their sobriety-are as fascinating as listening to people recount the plot of their dreams. With all due respect to Leo Tolstoy , all unhappy film families in which someone ascends those "12 steps" are exactly alike. Though certainly not as noxious as Rachel Getting Married , Craig Carlisle 's directorial debut similarly insists that we find charm in its protagonist's most odious behavior. Self-medicating to dull the pain of a dead dad, an ex-wife, and a mom (Grace Zabriskie ) who demotes him from VP of Sales in the family-futon emporium to its custodian, the titular drunk (Michael Leydon Campbell ) rages and pukes. Mother Funk insists her son enter therapy with a woman head-shrinker, which leads to AA meetings and the pretty new associate at the office (Rachael Leigh Cook ) telling Bob, "The truth is the only thing you never have to be ashamed of." Failing as a satire of cubicle culture (Amy Ryan 's inexplicable cameo only makes you wish you were watching The Office  ) and too thin to convincingly play out its redemption story, Bob Funk , at the very least, has no scenes on how to load a dishwasher properly.
