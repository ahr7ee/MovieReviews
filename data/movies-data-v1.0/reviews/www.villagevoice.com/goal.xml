      <text>&gt;Aside from a flirtation with the hot-button immigration issue, this inspirational movie about an underdog soccer player from tough East Los Angeles is pretty standard stuff. Mexican TV heartthrob Kuno Becker  stars as Santiago Munez , a rec league standout who lands a trial with the fabled Newcastle United  club of northeastern England. The appealing young man's tribulations are predictable, his triumph inevitable; while he gets respect (and  the girl, played by Anna Friel ), we get another Rocky -style dose of emotional uplift, cloaked in the usual game-day clichés. Not a bad movie, but as familiar as Alex Rodriguez 's batting average. Two sequels are already in the works&#151;probably aimed at the soccer-crazy international market. Brit director Danny Cannon  and Brit screenwriters Dick Clement  and Ian la Frenais  know their fútbol , but will American moviegoers pay to play?
