      <text>This dour, retrogressive WW II potboiler asks us to forget the last half-century of political and cultural tumult&#151;to say nothing of combat movie tropes&#151;in order to feel peachy about war again. Wearing its "based on a true story" imprimatur on its sleeve, the film follows a U.S. Army  squadron on a mission in the Philippines to spring doomed Yanks from a Japanese P.O.W. camp. John Dahl  is too careful a director to make this stuff dull: His methodical approach serves the movie's thesis that group efforts, not individual heroics, win battles, and the titular raid is a real showstopper. But Philippines  B-movie luminary Eddie Romero  wrung greater complexity from similar material 40 years ago, and his movies never trafficked in risible Japanese stereotypes or ultra-expendable Filipino bit players. The Great Raid  is ultimately scotched by History Channel &#150;worthy nostalgia. It fails to capture the timely insouciance of, say, The Dirty Dozen  or Kelly's Heroes , war zone capers that dared to posit modern warfare as a playground for looters, homicidal maniacs, and morally vacant careerists. By comparison, Dahl's film oozes Bush-era artistic timidity.
