      <text>This flat-footed male weepie musters an insurance ad's worth of clich√©s about the importance of busting a move in middle age&#151;and it strains so hard to do so that it's almost perversely compelling. Grieving the loss of his wife, a timid bakery owner (Robert Carlyle ) on a routine delivery happens upon a car wreck victim (John Goodman ) who remains near death and chatty for much, much longer than it takes him to explain that he was en route to meet a childhood sweetheart at the titular school when fate thumbed a ride. Persuaded to keep the "dying" stranger's appointment for him, our widowed baker hero ends up scoring on the dancefloor with a fellow wallflower (Marisa Tomei ), leading to a risible love scene wherein co-writer&#150;director Randall Miller  yearns to do for sexy breadmaking what Ghost  did for sexy pottery. A veteran of Sinbad and Kid 'N Play  vehicles, Miller apparently couldn't secure studio financing even for this, a 12-step movie of square-dance convention.
