      <text>The trifling, clich√©-choked trophy indie Robert Moresco  got to make after the success of Crash  (which he co-wrote), 10th &amp; Wolf  is a hellish and unconvincing celebration of badda-bing-ness, supposedly based on a story by Joseph Pistone , the real-life "Donnie Brasco " (though Pistone's name appears nowhere in the credits). After being raised in the mob, Tommy (James Marsden ) joins the Marines  and then, at the behest of feds, returns to the Philly neighborhood where his dim brother Vincent (Brad Renfro ) is getting knee-deep in shit and his cold-blooded cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi ) is already some kind of rising goodfella. Whackings proliferate; out of spite, rage, or greed, the boys' mom (ultra-floozie Lesley Ann Warren ) enables the situation; and flashbacks to dunderheaded Dennis Hopper  and Val Kilmer  cameos enliven the muck. Mostly, though, it's a nonstop caricature fest; one cannot decide whom Ribisi is inadvertently parodying with his grimaces and glowerings, Robert De Niro  or himself. (Marsden, without his Cyclops shades, has the dullest pretty-boy face to never grace a Calvin Klein  billboard.) "Young Hollywood " neo-aristocracy posturing like gun-crazy street urchins&#151;I'd rather watch Growing Up Gotti   for the first time.
