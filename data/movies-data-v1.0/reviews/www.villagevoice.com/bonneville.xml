Three middle-aged Mormon ladies from Idaho  tie scarves around their heads, don sunglasses, and fly across the American landscape in a convertible like they're Thelma and Louise , yet this rarity in cinema—a graying cast in a female-bonding adventure—couldn't be more dull-humored or predictably maudlin without just calling itself The Bucket List 2 . Arvilla (Jessica Lange ) wants to honor her late husband's wishes of spreading his cremated ashes, but her bitchy stepdaughter (Christine Baranski ) will steal her house away if she doesn't send what's left of "Daddy" to Santa Barbara . Road trip! Accompanied by sassmouth Margene (Kathy Bates ) and prissy pragmatist Carol (Joan Allen )—the latter a plant for the Latter-Day Saints : "Oh my heck, I think I just drank vodka," or "Coffee? What kind of a Mormon are you?"—Arvilla sets out on a journey of enlightenment in which all three women will learn a little something about themselves, and how best to make us roll our eyes. First-time director Christopher N. Rowley  and writer Daniel D. Davis  have created a safe fantasy world where all truckers are gentlemen, as are the hitchhikers, and women stereotypically break anything they try to drive.
