      <text>Using the same factual basis that inspired the recent courtroom shocker The Exorcism of Emily Rose  , this quietly unnerving psychological study from German director Hans-Christian Schmid  wields its ambiguity about religion and science like a double-edged blade. Freely adapting the story of Anneliese Michel , a 23-year-old German student who died in 1976 after a grueling exorcism, Schmid and screenwriter Bernd Lange  imagine the girl (here called Michaela) as more Carrie White  than Regan MacNeil &#151;an epileptic, sexually blossoming seeker whose fits seem logical (and understandable) as explosive tantrums at her repressive religious upbringing. But Sandra HÃ¼ller , a young German stage actress making a harrowing feature debut, invests Michaela's terrified, possibly schizophrenic outbursts with unholy conviction: When she claws toward a crucifix in mortal terror, the devil's handiwork no longer seems a remote possibility. Or maybe it's more appealing than the alternatives: a god who would allow such suffering as a test of divine allegiance&#151;or no god at all, just the mind and its endless capacity for self-torture.
