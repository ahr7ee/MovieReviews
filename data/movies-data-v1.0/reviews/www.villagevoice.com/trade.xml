Based on a 2004 New York Times Magazine   article about the sex-trafficking business and starring a very straight-faced Kevin Kline , Trade  should be a gritty, multifaceted, high-minded story about the price and politics of human slavery. Instead, it's pure exploitation&#151;the kind of movie after which you need a long, hot shower. German director Marco Kreuzpaintner 's movie looks  like Traffic  and Syriana &#151;clearly his role models&#151;but is little more than our generation's version of 1979's Hardcore . It's set mostly in Mexico, where girls are snatched from streets and airports to become unwilling sex slaves&#151;among them Veronica (Alicja Bachleda-Curus ), who is lured to Mexico from Poland  and is set to go up for auction in New Jersey, and Adriana (Paulina Gaitan ), a teenager knocked off her bike and snatched in the broad-daylight streets of Mexico City. From Mexico to Jersey, we see plenty of pit stops at which these women (and, in one ghastly sequence, a young boy) are abused. (Kline's here as a cop looking for his own grown daughter.) The filmmaker has managed to take an exhaustive and troubling investigative story and render it into a tawdry little thriller. Among its myriad problems is the fact Trade  doesn't say anything about sex trafficking other than "Wow, it's horrible."
