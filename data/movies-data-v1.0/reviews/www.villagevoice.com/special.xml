That superhero triumphalism continues to dominate Hollywood  is a peculiar trend in our pop-cultural history, but it makes the trickle down into character-driven, low-budget Sundance indies almost inevitable. In Special , a meek meter reader with fanboy proclivities (Michael Rappaport ) enrolls in a clinical trial for an experimental anti-depressant, after which he develops powers like levitation, ESP, and the ability to pass through walls. With his newfound self-confidence, he dons a homemade costume and preemptively tackles evildoers while they're still scheming in their heads, but could this cat simply be missing a couple marbles? In the first act alone, writer-directors Hal Haberman  and Jeremy Passmore  give up their "Is he or isn't he?" game by showing us a sane observer's point of viewâ€”yes, this pathetic nut is swimming on the floor, not hovering inches above. All that's left then is a miserablist analogue to M. Night Shyamalan 's Unbreakable , a sad portrait of paranoid delusion with wipe-out stunts played for the comic wincing of Jackass . Rappaport's befuddled sincerity has never registered so poignantly, but given its singular premise, for the film to waste an easy opportunity to satirize vigilante do-goodery and pharmaceutical dependence is, well, villainous.
