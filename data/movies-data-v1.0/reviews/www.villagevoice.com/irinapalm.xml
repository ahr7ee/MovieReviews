Nobody can reduce tawdry material to doddering quaintness like the British, but this staggeringly inane joint effort of U.K., Belgian, French, German, and Luxembourgian film financing represents a true coalition of the witless. With her dying grandson unable to afford life-saving treatment in Australia—so much for Michael Moore 's miracles of socialized medicine—a matronly middle-aged widow (Marianne Faithfull !) timidly answers a London sex club's job posting. Dutifully divested of diva-hood, Faithfull is stationed at a glory hole with enough lotion to capsize Eliot Spitzer , instructed to polish every knob that pokes through. Voila!  She finds mad money, likely romance, and newfound self-esteem, as so often happens with aging sex workers in the anonymous coin-op jerk-off trade. The whole ridiculous thing could serve as one of Lars von Trier 's lurid melodramas of female abasement, if director Sam Garbarski 's tone didn't fluctuate between kitchen-sink miserabilism and the smirky archness of a Very Special Are You Being Served? —and if it weren't such a pack of cozily sanitized lies. Except, of course, for the movie's urgent warning about the hazards of "penis elbow."
