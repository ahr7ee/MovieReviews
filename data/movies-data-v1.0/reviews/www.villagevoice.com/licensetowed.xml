      <text>A blitzed-looking man stumbling out of a screening of this dreadful excuse for an unromantic comedy volunteered that the best part of the movie was when Robin Williams  got socked in the jaw. Couldn't agree more&#151;but if you like your Williams spewing rat-a-tat gags and substituting stand-up for acting, you'll love him as an obsessive priest bearing down on a dewy-eyed engaged couple (Mandy Moore  and The Office 's John Krasinski) in Ken Kwapis's high-concept, low-minded riff on the current vogue for marriage-prep classes. Mistaking sadism for satire, sight gags for physical comedy, and stupidity for good nature, the movie has the Rev drive a wedge between the happy couple by spying on them, banning them from sex, and equipping them with animatronic babies emitting blue poop&#151;all designed to bring them the shocking news that weddings may be fun, but marriage is serious business. Moore, who made a great high school meanie in The Princess Diaries  and Saved! , is nothing more than a series of toothy reaction shots. The lone saving grace in this mean-spirited rubbish is Krasinski, serenely refusing to chew scenery with the rest.
