This wackily uneven drama from director Bill Duke  opens with Atlanta photographer and housewife Valerie Maas  (Aunjanue Ellis ) sitting in a police interrogation room trying to explain to a doubting detective (Lou Gossett Jr.)  why she's not guilty of murder. Flashbacks reveal that Valerie and her husband Dutch (Razaaq Adoti ) have become entangled in the sordid lives of Dutch's new boss (Roger Guenveur Smith ) and a creepy rap star (the actor known as "Leon") who has set his sights on Valerie. These folks are knee-deep in sin, the nitty-gritty details of which it wouldn't be fair to reveal. This is a weirdly schizophrenic movie, one that's light on the murder mystery and heavy on the sermonizing, particularly when Valerie's church-basement women's group—which seems to meet hourly—starts wailing about the devilish temptations luring African-American men from God and family. Duke appears to be aiming for a Tyler Perry –style mix of the taboo and the saintly, but his touch is leaden.
