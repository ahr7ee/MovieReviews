      <text>Based on a novel by the Italian author Alessandro Baricco  that I will assume was more coherent than this mess of an adaptation, Francois Girard&#146;s Silk stars Michael Pitt  as Herve, a confused-looking French silkworm trader sent on a mission to Japan  by his boss, Baldabiou (Alfred Molina , trying his best). While there, he becomes infatuated with a concubine (Sei Ashina), despite the fact that they only see each other about twice and never exchange a word. Meanwhile, waiting for Herve at home is his fetching wife Helene (Keira Knightley , who isn&#146;t given much to do but bat her eyelashes and loll around in a field of lilies). Silk isn&#146;t just bad. It&#146;s utterly mad. It stutters and hiccups from scene to scene, from country to country, but never once does it make narrative or emotional sense. The scenes in France are a series of goopy, sentimental tableaux worthy of Bouguereau. The scenes in Japan are full of lush, white mists and little else. Girard is not only uncritically preoccupied with that nation&#146;s Otherness&#151;the mystic Orient&#151;but also with the female body. The camera treats Helene and her Japanese counterpart as pretty knickknacks, silent vessels for Herve&#146;s uninspiring, aimless lust.
