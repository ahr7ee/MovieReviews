      <text>Good zombie movies are metaphorical; Slither  allegorizes living-dead horror as a critique of the American heartland's boundless gluttony. The film's aliens enter their victims through the mouth or stomach and compel people to consume endless quantities of meat&#151;they grow so morbidly obese that they literally explode with extraterrestrial evil. Writer-director James Gunn , who wrote Tromeo  &amp; Juliet  and the Dawn of the Dead  remake, is obviously a fan of the genre, and he's filled his movie with an encyclopedic onslaught of cinematic references: the town bar, for instance, is named Henenlotter's after the director of 1982's Basket Case , whose creature bears more than a passing resemblance to some of Slither 's. The larger plot is a blend of Night of the Living Dead  and Cronenberg's version of The Fly : the decimation of a small town overrun by flesh-craving space slugs set against a love triangle among the aliens' first victim, his wife, and the town sheriff (Michael Rooker , Elizabeth Banks , and Nathan Fillion , respectively). Gunn doesn't reinvent the wheel but he does tighten its spokes a bit with some terrifying sequences and a witty, deadpan screenplay, and he leaves the audience hungry&#151;for Slither 2 .
