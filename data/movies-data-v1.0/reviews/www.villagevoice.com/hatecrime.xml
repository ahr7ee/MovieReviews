      <text>In a Dallas suburb, a homophobic preacher's son (Chad Donella) moves next door to a handsome gay couple (Seth Peterson  and Brian J. Smith ). Given this setup and the rather unsubtle title&#151;both redolent of made-for-TV dramas and the gay film fest circuit&#151;you would think you know what happens next. But first-time director Tommy Stovall  stirs in enough plot twists (some more plausible than others) to keep you guessing&#151;as well as seething with frustration. When Hate Crime  confounds expectations, it transcends the whodunit-of-the-week template. On the other hand, when the plot gets lost in irrational revenge fantasies, you'll wish you had stayed home watching reruns. Bonus points for luxury casting: Bruce Davison  as the cartoonish Bible-thumping dad, creepily reminiscent of his X-Men  role, and Giancarlo Esposito  as a detective whose prejudice threatens to veer the investigation off course, along with the rest of the film.
