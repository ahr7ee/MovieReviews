      <text>Retooling Larry Collins  and Dominique Lapierre 's sprawling 1972 docu-novel about the birth of Israel  around a sorely tested friendship between a Jew (J.J. Feild ) and an Arab (Saïd Taghmaoui ), this adorably clumsy melodrama has going for it a conciliatory spirit intended to warm the liberal heart. That's also a weakness, with director Elie Chouraqui  and co-writer Didier Lepecheur  falling prey to a fatal even-handedness that reduces a complex battle for the loveliest, most fought-over city in the world to a pile of heroic clichés. Though no one actually breaks into song, the cheesy battle scenes and even cheesier romantic backstory will have you waiting in vain for a musical. Politics pops its head in here and there, but it's hard to stay focused when Ian Holm , as Ben Gurion , keeps rushing around in electrocuted hair extensions, declaiming history. Imagine watching Otto Preminger 's equally silly 1960 Exodus  now and you'll have O Jerusalem  , minus Paul Newman 's blue-eyed wink.
