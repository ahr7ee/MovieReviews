      <text>Blind man's ruff: Sappy revenge drama is worst in show
Missing from Unleashed  is every hallmark of good filmmaking, but its most glaring omission is a cliché: Morgan Freeman 's trademark voice-over. Freeman plays Sam, a blind piano tuner who dispenses homilies that, mysteriously, are restricted to the film's dialogue. One particular Freeman pearl&#151;"Pianos are a lot like people, you pound on 'em and they get all out of tune"&#151;is a guiding metaphor for protag Danny (Jet Li ), who has spent his life enslaved to Bart (Bob Hoskins ), a psychotic Glasgow  loan shark. Bart raised Danny to believe he is a dog, and whenever Bart removes Danny's collar&#151;and commands, "Get him!"&#151;the otherwise docile Li becomes a deadly kung fu enforcer. After Danny escapes Bart and his cockney crew, he is adopted by Sam and his perky teenage stepdaughter, who teach their noble savage how to be a human.
In desperate need of its own tonal adjustment, Unleashed  awkwardly appends its brief fight scenes to an incompatibly wholesome family drama. Written by Luc Besson , and directed by hack protégé Louis Leterrier  (The Transporter ), the bulk of this cloying dreck concerns Danny's sentimental education, and were it not for Li's intermittent martial arts sequences, this could just as easily have been a vehicle for Tom Hanks . The story slouches toward a vengeful denouement, but when Danny wants to kill Bart, Sam talks him out of murdering his former captor with pleas that sound cribbed from Freeman's unsuccessful appeals to Brad Pitt  in Seven . Danny's restraint is a sign of his newfound humanity and an affirmation of Sam's unintentionally onanistic advice: "Nothing like self-discovery for turning a boy into a man."
