      <text>In Tony Bill 's romantic, computer-generated fantasy, the plucky volunteer pilots of World War I's Lafayette Escadrille are once more cast as "knights of the sky," dashing young Americans (James Franco , Martin Henderson , and Abdul Salis  among them) who soar aloft in flimsy wood-and-canvas biplanes, shoot down a glowering Hun or two over verdant France, then return to the chateau to quaff cognac and sing bawdy ballads in tribute to their fallen comrades. In other words, here is the War to End All Wars seen from on high&#151;as it was way back when, in Wings  or the Howard Hughes  Hell's Angels  &#151;a world apart from the grim, futile slaughterhouses of Verdun and the Marne. Among these combatants, you won't find much All Quiet on the Western Front &#150;style despair, and the paths of glory are unsullied by doubt or disillusionment. With Jennifer Decker  as a thankful mademoiselle and veteran Jean Reno  as the Americans' French commanding officer.
