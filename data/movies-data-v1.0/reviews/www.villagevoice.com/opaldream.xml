      <text>Rush screaming from anything that announces itself as "a movie for children and grown-ups of all ages." Slight and shamelessly saccharine, Opal Dream  is devoted to the proposition that it takes an Australian-outback village to validate the imaginary friends of a blond child who is too sensitive for this world but not, alas, for this sappy movie. Adapted from what I suspect is a much better children's novel by Ben Rice , the story turns on eight-year-old Kellyanne (Sapphire Boyce ), an arty type who takes after her precious-stone-prospecting dad (Vince Colosimo ) and does the pale-and-consumptive thing when her ethereal buddies Pobby and Dingan disappear. Everything goes wrong, until suddenly everything goes right when Kellyanne's practical brother, Ashmol (Christian Byers), and their long-suffering mum (Jacqueline McKenzie ) rustle up all the crusty salt-of-the-earth types in their dusty village to bond in sympathy for the vanishing dreams of children large and small. Awkwardly directed by Peter Cattaneo , who also made The Full Monty , Opal Dream  is burdened with lashings of that movie's schmaltz, but none of its raucous comedy. Pardon my disbelief, but even G-rated tots will roll their worldly little eyes.
