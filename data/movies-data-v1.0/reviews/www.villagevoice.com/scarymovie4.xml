      <text>Part three was so wretched, it actually made you miss the Wayans brothers, but the fourth Scary Movie  has its share of good laughs. It unspools like a Mad  magazine parody, primarily of The Grudge  and War of the Worlds , but also some lesser targets both obvious (Saw ) and not (Fahrenheit 9/11 ). Anna Faris  returns, this time channeling Sarah Michelle Gellar , while Craig Bierko &#151;underrated as a comic actor&#151;goes to town on Hollywood 's biggest target, Tom Cruise . (Other good spoof-casting choices include Chris Elliott  for Adrien Brody  and Bill Pullman  for William Hurt  in The Village , and Charlie Sheen  for Pullman in The Grudge .) The jokes miss more than they hit, but there are a lot of them, and when they work, it's gold. (A gag that involves a car's automatic-locking system is utterly brilliant.) And given that director David Zucker  recently became a Republican, bonus points for all the jokes involving Leslie Nielsen  as a familiarly bumbling president.
