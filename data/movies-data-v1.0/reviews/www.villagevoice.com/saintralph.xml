      <text>Catholic schoolboy Ralph Walker  (Adam Butcher ) quixotically enters the 1954 Boston Marathon, magically thinking that a big Beantown victory constitutes a miracle&#151;and only a "miracle," according to a doctor, will awaken his comatose mother.

Discovering that it's all made up renders the experience even more pointless. The race itself is a suspenseful sequence of slo-mo uplift&#151;suspenseful in the binary sports flick sense of either he wins or he loses, uplifting insofar as it's a music video scored to yet another version of Leonard Cohen 's "Hallelujah," that de rigueur dirge that gives every montage from Shrek   to the O.C  .'s first-season finale a numinous coating of epiphany. There are points of contact with two other recent Catholic-youth titles: Millions  (with its similar saint fixation) and House of D  (fatherless boy, ailing mom). The most blatant rip-off is of the Rushmore  soundtrack. But Ralph Walker is no Max Fischer , and his monomania gets dull fast.
