      <text>For any high-fivin' "Movies for Guys Who Like Movies" bros hoping for the Guy Ritchie  of yore, Revolver  disappoints. It's no return to rock, this, but rather Ritchie's soporific, proggy-conceptual Film of Ideas, with Vivaldi  interludes, fussbudget set design, recurrent references to chess, and a hit man inexplicably got up as Tati's Mr. Hulot. Hobbling stateside after a raping from the U.K. press, Revolver 's nothing if not eccentric; at times, I halfway admired the suicidal gambit of making such a gnomic self-actualization gangster pic. All the crime-saga tropes are accounted for&#151;the ronin badass, feuding rival gangs, an invisible criminal overboss&#151;but they do double-duty as allegorical points on the film's schematic layout. Jake Green  (Jason Statham ) is no sooner released from prison than he's back feuding with casino sleaze Dorothy (Ray Liotta , explosively deviant), but things swiftly go down the rabbit hole as he's indentured to and lectured by a mysterious duo of loan-shark gurus (Andre Benjamin  and Vincent Pastore ). The plot's hieroglyphic symbolism adds up, finally, to some kind of lesson about the Ego, a fact confirmed by a line-up of Ph.D.'s (and Deepak Chopra ) who pop on-screen to tell you exactly that before the credits roll.
