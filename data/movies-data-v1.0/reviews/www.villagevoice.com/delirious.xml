      <text>Agently attitudinous, generally zippy urban fairy tale about pop stars and the hangers-on who coddle (or prey upon) them, Tom DiCillo 's Delirious  is a mild Midnight Cowboy , a minor King of Comedy , and mainly a vehicle for Steve Buscemi  as a lower Manhattan&#150;based paparazzo. Not entirely by accident, a dumb, sweet, homeless hunk (Michael Pitt ) becomes an unpaid intern for the irascible photographer (seedy even by Buscemi standards), then manages to connect with one of the celebrity-stalker's subjects, a Spearsoid mediocrity played by Alison Lohman . Pitt falls in love with the singer's image and is swept into a VIP world where the camera mediates every emotion, particularly once he is adopted by Gina Gershon 's predatory casting director. DiCillo has a feel for this milieu&#151;the "Soap Stars Against STD" banquet and a scene in which two cell-wielding flacks negotiate their clients' impending rope-line reunion are minor classics&#151;as well as an eye for downtown glamour. (His 1991 feature Johnny Suede   gave then&#150;TV actor Brad Pitt  his first starring role; that film also established Catherine Keener 's screen persona.) As a director, DiCillo has an evident rapport with his actors. Lohman demonstrates a hitherto unexplored comic timing in the mock music video "Take Your Love and Shove It." But it's Buscemi who imbues the movie with a scabrous pathos that is scarcely mitigated by the final flash-bulb white-out. A former cinematographer, DiCillo has always made visually fastidious movies. Perhaps this is the case with Delirious , but I can't be sure&#151;demonstrating a brainless contempt for everyone concerned, the movie's PR firm chose to press-screen a cruddy digital transfer branded throughout with the frame-wide inscription "Property of Peace Arch Films."
