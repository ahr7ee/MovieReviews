      <text>A blow-by-blow remake of American Pie , albeit with more gerbil sex play, Another Gay Movie  follows four strapping guys from San Torum High School  trying to lose their (anal) cherry. Boasting a Scary Movie  rate of scatalogical jokes-per-minute, it fails to match that franchise's low yield of guffaws. Even with shit, timing is everything, and AGM  jumps from emission to emission with exhausting alacrity. Offering some respite is Scott Thompson  in the Eugene Levy  role. As with its hetero template, the gags slow down for sentiment, and the likable cast is allowed a few moments sans fluids. Jonah Blechman  proves especially game as the Hollywood -obsessed queen with a killer Paul Lynde  impression, but soon he's interrupted by someone getting poked in the eye with a cock.
