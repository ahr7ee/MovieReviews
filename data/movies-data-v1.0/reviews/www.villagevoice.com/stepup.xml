      <text>Borrowing heavily from predecessors like Fame  and Save the Last Dance , choreographer- turned-director Anne "Mama" Fletcher has made a dance romance that might provoke the old Brooklyn  disco king Tony Manero  to grab a big hammer and go Italian-crazy on the plagiarists. Buff Channing Tatum , late of She's the Man , is a second-rate Eminem  type from the seedy reaches of Baltimore, and his only outlet is busting a few moves. Pretty Jenna Dewan  is the ambitious rich girl who needs a new dance partner for her senior showcase number. Bingo. When the raw meets the refined, art heals all wounds and romance blossoms&#151;at least in this familiar vision of showbiz success. Fletcher ably blends ballet and hip-hop, but the filming itself is often clumsy, and Tatum's relentless African American impersonation quickly wears out its welcome.
