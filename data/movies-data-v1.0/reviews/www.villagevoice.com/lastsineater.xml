      <text>Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is arguably the most iconic female villain in film history. The miscasting of Fletcher&#151;still a forbidding screen presence&#151;as a kindly grandmother is only one of many missteps that director Michael Landon Jr.  (yes, it's his son) makes in The Last Sin Eater, the tale of a guilt-wracked 10-year-old in mid-19th-century Appalachia . Little Cadi (Liana Liberato ) is convinced that she caused the death of her younger sister and obsessed with absolving her crime by finding the "sin eater"&#151;a member of the community who allegedly grants redemption to the worldly. Liberato muddles through a heavy-handed Christian agenda and barely legible plot as the film follows Cadi through the woods on various sin-expunging missions, sometimes accompanied by an imaginary sprite or her pseudo-love-interest Fagan. Toward the end of the film, Cadi and Fagan stumble on a "Man of God," who teaches them, and the rest of the village, that there are no mortal sin eaters: Only Jesus can nosh on your transgressions.
