      <text>We call it soccer, but for the Brits, it's football, and it's damn serious business. From 1968 to 1974, Brian Clough  (Michael Sheen ), a manager/coach from the tiny town of Derby, and his assistant manager, Peter Taylor  (Timothy Spall ), turned a third-rate club into division champs. That success wasn't nearly as sweet as getting to take over Leeds United , a top-tier team previously managed by Clough's arch enemy, Don Revie  (Colm Meaney ). In this terrific film, screenwriter Peter Morgan  (The Queen , Frost/Nixon ) and television director Tom Hooper  (John Adams  ), making his feature debut, use a series of elegantly staged flashbacks to trace Clough and Taylor's rapid rise to fame, and the hubris that led the former to stumble badly when he got to Leeds , while also wounding his lifelong friendship with Taylor. A movie about soccer that doesn't spend a lot of time on the field, The Damned United , like everything Morgan writes, is an intimate character study, one that is enriched by a stellar ensemble of British pros, including Jim Broadbent  as Derby's team owner. These actors are good at what they doâ€”like those soccer players that dodge and weave with effortless grace.
