      <text>Hollywood 's a sucker for cross-dressing, but if you're looking for drag kings , you're pretty much stuck with Yentl . She's the Man , in which a teenage girl must go undercover at a private school to play soccer, doesn't have an unpredictable moment in it, borrowing heavily from just about every sports movie or teen comedy ever and, oh yeah, Twelfth Night . What it does have is teen-queen-turned-drag-king Amanda Bynes , who tackles the lead role of Viola/Sebastian with enough enthusiasm to wring laughs from the retread story. Other rays of light come from the adult supporting cast, particularly David Cross  and Vinnie Jones .
