      <text>Admit it: For years you've been burning to know what ol' Phyllis Diller  really thinks about electric cars, which first (dis)appeared in her youth. "They were very quiet," she recalls. (Isn't a Mack truck quiet compared to Phyllis Diller?) The real question is why this purportedly impassioned documentary investigation of a great subject&#151;the culture's conspiratorial dismissal of eco-friendly alternatives to the gas-guzzler&#151;would assume such massive viewer disinterest that it coats the pill with C-list celebrity NutraSweet , including Martin Sheen  voiceovers ("As the 20th century gathered speed . . . ") that would sound unforgivably hackneyed even on basic cable. An opening vignette in a California cemetery has GM's produced-and-abandoned EV-1 being "buried" by tearful mourners (ha-ha); subsequent title cards, complete with Fox News &#150;ish animation (whoosh!), finger so many of the usual suspects (e.g., carmakers, lawmakers, big oil, us) that the titular question might as well be Who Didn't Kill . . . ?  Director Chris Paine 's choice of talking heads leads you to think that famous people were the only ones lucky enough to have leased GM's now flattened roadster&#151;until the awkward slip of his would-be audience surrogate, a "former EV-1 specialist," appears to reveal that his own model has somehow been tucked away for safe keeping. Another few of these squandered opportunities for art-house muckraking and we'll need someone to ask who killed the left-wing documentary.
