      <text>In a just world, Sean Fine  and Andrea Nix 's documentary wouldn't exist&#151; at least not in this fashion. The rebel group known as the Lord's Resistance Army  would not have been free to ravage northern Uganda , butchering parents, raping and killing children, and displacing entire towns of civilians; failing that, at the very least there would be no alarm needed to alert the rest of the world to the atrocities&#151;among them the conversion of kidnapped children into forced killers. But in the existing marketplace, entertainment, not social consciousness, is the currency&#151;hence this wake-up call couched in a strenuously upbeat inspirational sports doc.
The sport is Uganda's national music and dance competition; the underdog heroes are Dominic, Rose, and Nancy, three orphaned teens in the Patongo refugee camp, whose school troupe is the first to represent rough-and-tumble northern Uganda against the more cosmopolitan south. They tell their horrific stories of mutilation and murder directly to the camera, while the reliance on picturesque backdrops, high-energy performances, and countdown-to-the-big-show narrative gambits begs you not to watch something easier on the conscience. The movie comes across as desperately, even irritatingly contrived, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it overcame my naturally complacent instincts&#151;which would be to watch something (anything ) else, to not get haunted by that closing litany of websites for global action.
