      <text>Sanaa Hamri's brisk, refreshingly understated romantic comedy Something New  is the rare movie that delivers on its title's promise. By bluntly integrating race and class into its stock love-conquers-all story line, this innovative fairy tale&#151;which neither resorts to overblown palliatives nor shortchanges its genre bona fides&#151; effectively diminishes the stink of do-gooder dross like last year's Crash .
Hamri's film shares the same L.A. setting and bourgeois perspective as that self-important mess, but little else. Her African American heroine, Kenya  (Sanaa Lathan ), is a rising star at a high-end accounting firm with little time to devote to finding a husband. Enter Brian (Simon Baker ), a laid-back, New Agey, very available landscape architect (none dare call him yardman) who happens to be white. Kenya's well-heeled parents (Earl Billings  and Alfre Woodard , who gleefully plays against type) and a trio of her gal pals weigh in on the budding relationship, while another potential suitor (Blair Underwood  as an unctuous IBM , or "ideal black man") threatens to undo it.
The plotting may be familiar and mundane, but that's precisely what makes Something New  work: Its thorny, mostly unresolved questions of identity and racial affiliation are couched in identifiable everyday concerns, like dealing with job and family stress and worrying that a suitable mate may never turn up. In the end, the film is a lucid, tender appeal for flexibility, and no amount of carjackings, LAPD shakedowns, or freeway conflagrations can rival the pleasure of seeing such a concept so engagingly explored.
