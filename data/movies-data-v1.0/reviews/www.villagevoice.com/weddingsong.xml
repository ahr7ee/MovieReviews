      <text>Like her appealing first feature, La petite Jérusalem  , Karin Albou 's The Wedding Song  probes the threats to an intimate bond between two Semitic women. Here, World War II steps in to test a happy friendship between Tunisian neighbors—Nour (Olympe Borval ), a devout Muslim, and Myriam (Lizzie Brocheré ), a secular Jew. The prospect of Nazi invasion, with the collusion of a French administration only too happy to refuel latent tensions between Arabs and Jews, threatens a bond already complicated by the romantic entanglement of one girl and the prospect of a forced marriage for the other. Though lovely to look at, The Wedding Song  is a little overwhelmed by its relentlessly hyper-poetic imagery—all those enormous eyes staring in fright from nocturnal shadows incongruously makes you think of crying-kitten posters. The overdetermined pressures of the big picture, with war, class, race, and religion crammed into every frame, threaten to turn each character into a historical position paper. Still, this spirited film sustains its momentum as a tale of powerless women uniting to take back control of their destinies.
