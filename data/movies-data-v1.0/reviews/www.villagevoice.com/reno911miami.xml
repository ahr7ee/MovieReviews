Norbit has nothing on Niecy Nash , who proudly parades her prosthetic ass along Miami Beach , lowering oceanside property values with each thunderous step. The joke here is that the snooty pastel metropolis needs to be taken down a few rungs by Nash and her law-enforcement crew from the Comedy Central  show Reno 911  (basically a lampoon of Cops , only dumber, if that's possible). The series regulars&#151;including director Robert Ben Garant , Thomas Lennon , and Kerri Kenney-Silver &#151;accomplish this task with signature incompetence. With the city's regular police force trapped inside a quarantined convention, our gang from Reno  confronts backyard gators, a bad Scarface  imitator (Paul Rudd ), and even Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson in a good-natured cameo. The TV show excels with its short squad-car bursts of random inanity; here, the plot&#151;stretched out to 84 minutes&#151;feels like a dime bag tossed aside by a fleeing perp.
