Former Loveline  and The Man Show   co-host Adam Carolla  brings his self-deprecating, improvisational, regular-dude deadpan—as well as his former Golden Gloves  status—to this semi-autobiographical comedy with ambitions so low that one might call it charmingly mediocre. Carolla's sitcom-grade doppelgänger is Jerry Ferro , a once-promising southpaw with the titular nickname who quit boxing for a life of menial construction jobs and a girlfriend who loathes him. After a ludicrous sparring match against a beefy up-and-comer, the unfit 40-year-old tries for one last shot at Olympic glory, and Carolla tries to sell us on the mustiest of underdog premises. Directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld  (Kissing Jessica Stein ) and written by long-time Carolla producer Kevin Hench , the film is essentially Rocky Balboa   in a lighter weight class, with snarky barbs, a wacky Nicaraguan sidekick (Oswaldo Castillo ), and a too-good-to-be-true love interest (Heather Juergensen , Hench's wife and she who smooched Jessica Stein ). With collaborators like these, it's surprising the film doesn't feature lesbians jumping on trampolines, too.
