      <text>Lexi Alexander 's debut feature owes its pint-fueled proletarian angst and aggro to David Fincher  and Alan Clarke . Hooligans  nods at Fight Club  with whip-pan-filled melees and a not-more-than-usual amount of unaddressed homoerotic exclusivity ("What happens at football stays at football"). But in reality, it's rarely about football for the "soccer" hooligan, who privileges pre-arranged beat-downs over bicycle kicks&#151;an irony that the film's punch-up porn problematically acknowledges. Enlisting Nicholas Nickleby  and a hobbit to play a hard East Ender and his Yank protégé seems ludicrous, but Charlie Hunnam  is charismatic as a Green Street alpha geezer and Elijah Wood 's all wide-eyed innocence as a disgraced Harvard J-student who falls in with the West Ham  lads. Hunnam, whose cockney ranges from dodgy to downright Caine-ian, mutes Gary Oldman 's bestial mouth-froth (in Clarke's 1988 The Firm ), becoming the prettiest, most articulate, bloodthirsty thug ever to put lip to lager. He nicks the film, lock, stock, and something about a barrel. Hooligans  loses the plot late though&#151;in the filmic and Brit-speak sense&#151;revealing Hollywood , not hooligan, roots.
