      <text>Hard to believe that it's been 20 years since the release of The Princess Bride , if only because it hasn't aged a day. Bereft of the pop-culture gags that curdle the Shrek   movies and absent the cynicism of most other kids' films used solely to peddle fast food and impulse items, it remains a spellbinding experience&#151;a fractured fairy tale spastic with ironic twitches that melt away beneath the joy and warmth with which Rob Reiner  and William Goldman  tell their story. And it's even more special because The Princess Bride is one of the few truly great movies that a parent can watch with a young child; never once does the grown-up satire strangle the swashbuckling romance. Better still, there's nothing formulaic or silly about it&#151;charges that Pauline Kael  leveled at children's cinema in a mid-'60s essay about how Walt Disney had ruined movies for kids by peddling "pacifiers" to them so their parents could zone out for 90 minutes.
The trailer for Disney 's new Enchanted   at least suggested that it aspired to Princess Bride greatness; if nothing else, it didn't look like something concocted in a test lab. The premise had promise: Characters from a "vintage" Disney movie suddenly find themselves thrust into our world&#151;Times Square , to be precise, long a retrofitted, sterilized amusement park anyway. Disney, referencing everything from Fantasia  to Toy Story in the advertisements, has sold the film as something both smartly postmodern and decidedly old-fashioned: merry maidens serenade white-collar princes, who joust with MTA  buses as wicked witches unleash fire-breathing dragons on midtown high-rises.
But somewhere between conception and execution, what could have been so much smart, sharp fun turned decidedly pedestrian. Director Kevin Lima  has made lousy Disney movies before&#151;2000's 102 Dalmatians , most recently, one in a long line of unnecessary and loathsome Disney sequels that squeezed every last penny out of those puppies. Enchanted , though, isn't even something to get worked up over&#151;not only because it's so boring, but because it can't even be bothered to adhere to its own internal logic. And while that may not sound like a big deal&#151;even a little nitpicky&#151;when your movie's got but a single gag, you have to tell the joke right.
Enchanted   fails from its very first moments, as Julie Andrews  (aw  . . .) narrates the opening animated sequence about a girl named Giselle (voiced by Amy Adams ) who, as she's being dressed by a m√©lange of woodland critters, pines for a Prince Charming to sweep her off her tired feet. The animation's meant to look old&#151;Disney, circa 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . But instead it looks shabby and shoddy&#151;Disney, circa 2002's direct-to-video Cinderella II: Dreams Come True .
Giselle meets and sings with hunky Prince Edward (James Marsden ), whose evil mommy, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon ), is none too pleased about a commoner taking her throne. So the queen, who's also a witch, dispatches Giselle to the Real World, the entranceway to which is a sewer that runs through Times Square. Before long, Giselle, now played by Adams in the flesh, rescues a divorce attorney named Robert (Patrick Dempsey ), who has little time for the whimsical or romantic. Which doesn't stop him from taking in Giselle and allowing her to sleep on his couch, in the same apartment he shares with his six-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey ). Because there aren't crazy people running around New York claiming to be princesses. Not at all.
The movie crumbles to teeny bits the next morning, when Giselle summons New York's indigenous wildlife&#151;chiefly rats and pigeons&#151;to clean Robert's nasty apartment, just as she'd done in the animated sequence. So the real world is apparently no different than the cartoon one? This obliterates the gag entirely. If a cartoon character can make magic in this  world, what's the rush in getting home?
