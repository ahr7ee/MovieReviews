Less a movie than a charm offensive beamed at those who thought My Big Fat Greek Wedding  was a masterpiece, writer-director Jason Todd Ipson 's all-too-autobiographical romantic comedy stars Jay Jablonski  as Jake, an addled Boston fishmonger with little to distinguish him beyond a fine set of washboard abs and a thing for stacked but unavailable Mediterranean women. Which means the only difference between Jake's married former squeeze (Marisa Petroro ) and the luscious veterinarian (Cerina Vincent ) reeled in for his benefit by his unusually literary employees is that the latter is threateningly unattached. Filling in for plot and theme (beyond "Will this unreconstructed man-child give up his childish pursuits and commit?") is a lot of loose talk about Freud and Shakespeare , some nice shots of Boston's Storrow Drive, jolly accordions on the soundtrack, a chorus of swearing North End Italians with warm hearts and funny accents, and a mercifully brief appearance by Penny Marshall . All that remains is to ask what this soggy excuse for a movie is doing on Roadside Attractions ' slate, while scores of promising independent filmmakers pray for distributionâ€”or at least an overtaxed arthouse in which to show off the fruits of their far superior labor.
