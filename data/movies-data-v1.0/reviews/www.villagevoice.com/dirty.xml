      <text>Considering the stock quality of the insights that the cop drama Dirty  has to offer us about Los Angeles (e.g., "This fucking city, I never could make sense of it"), it could easily have been shot in Vancouver  without any sacrifice in verisimilitude. If writer-director Chris Fisher , a Southern California native, insisted on staying local, he might at least have saved some money by renting that backlot used for a downtown intersection in Crash . No less than Crash  or Training Day , its more obvious model, this post-Rampart study of LAPD corruption takes place in a movie-set Los Angeles where people bellow didactically about race. Cuba Gooding Jr.  and Clifton Collins Jr.  (excellent as Perry Smith  in Capote ) habitually rise above their clich√©d roles as shady narc partners&#151;a "nigger" and a "bean"&#151;dreading their 6 p.m. appointment with internal affairs. But Fisher, who has a penchant for area serial killers (The Nightstalker  and the forthcoming Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders ), appears fixated on Los Angeles as a nihilistic phantasmagoria. For all its nominal grit, Dirty  lamentably has more in common with L.A. Story  than Boyz n the Hood .
