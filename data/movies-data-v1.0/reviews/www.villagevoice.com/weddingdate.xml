      <text>Calling all Derridettes: The headiest movie in the annual "Film Comment Selects" is surely The Ister , a three-hour Australian cine-essay inspired by Martin Heidegger 's 1942 lecture course on the 19th-century German poet Friedrich Hölderlin 's Danubian ode.
David Barison  and Daniel Ross 's digital-video doc travels upriver past presidential visitations (Romania ), bombed bridges (Serbia ), Stalin-era steelworks (Hungary ), Nazi concentration camps (Mauthausen ), and mock classical temples (Bavaria ) to the heart of darkness, the Black Forest cabin where Heidegger wrote Being and Time . There is evidently a German term for aquatic road movies&#151;wasserstrasse &#151;but The Ister  also offers a stream of consciousness. Three philosophers, including onetime bank robber Bernard Stiegler , and filmmaker Hans-Jürgen Syberberg  provide commentary on Greek myths, European history, and Heidegger's theory of agribusiness.
You may wonder if the humble DV mini-cam is the technology that enframes the river's essence. Indeed, the onrushing landscape, however despoiled, is a Bazinian counterpoint to the babbling brook of Heideggerian seinundzeitis . The movie's single Sunday-afternoon screening will be followed by a panel discussion.
