      <text>Dachau  diary: Schlöndorff's vision of a lost nine days
One of Germany's last remaining cine-excavators of Nazi-era irony, Volker Schlöndorff  speculates on what happened during the nine-day gap in Luxembourgian priest Jean Bernard 's famous Dachau diary, when he was given leave to return home and attend his mother's funeral. Thoroughly fictionalized, this anomalous incident is read as a diplomatic scheme, in which the haggard clergyman (Ulrich Matthes ) is encouraged by a baby-faced Nazi (August Diehl ) to dissuade the home-parish bishop from passively resisting the Third Reich . Schlöndorff and his scriptwriters (German TV pros Eberhard Görner  and Andreas Pflüger ) uncork all manner of fascist prevarication, as Diehl's self-interested career man attempts to cross-pollinate genocidal social philosophy with hearts-and-minds politicking, and essentially, outrageously, sell the idea of Dachau's necessity to the Dachau initiate. The church's collaborationism is a looming, sordid secondary target, naturally, and in fact, Schlöndorff's movie plays best as a dry exercise in historical doublespeak and rationalization. (Unfortunately, the scenes of arrest and incarceration are all smudged up with digital slo-mo "emphasis.") As the traumatized hero, Matthes (Goebbels in Downfall ) is nearly mute, a stunned and impenetrable cipher caught in the cogs of nationalist will.
