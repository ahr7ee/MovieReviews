      <text>A death in the family forces Hunt (Paul Rudd ), a Long Island  clam digger, to face up to his becalmed existence in Katherine Dieckmann&#146;s terrific movie about a dying way of life. The Ford-Carter debates simmer quietly in the background, but Dieckmann doesn&#146;t snow us with &#146;70s symbolism. This very particular movie has a lyrical feel for place, period, and the rhythms of a small-town community trying&#151;and tragicomically failing&#151;to run in place while the world around it opens its arms to creeping corporatism. Rudd is sweet and funny; Ron Eldard  and Josh Hamilton  are great as the town&#146;s aimless stud muffin and philosophizing pothead respectively. But the movie belongs to Ken Marino , who is riotously funny as the family man whose anger-management problem at last finds a fitting target in the big businessmen who come to destroy his living. Marino also wrote the outstanding script, which traps the foul-mouthed vitality of working-class speech in a bottle and makes it sing. Diggers is not a film you watch&#151;it&#146;s a movie you live in, and when time&#146;s up you feel the same sense of loss as do these guys, who realize they have no choice but to move on.
