      <text>Inhabiting the breezeway between the sweet sincerity of Beautiful Thing  and the didacticism of an ABC Afterschool Special , this upstate New York  coming-out saga will warm PFLAG hearts and kindle empathy in those who've had to tread the family-drama-churned waters of small-town gaydom. High school senior Dorian (Michael McMillian ) figures out why he has no friends and his angry Nixon-worshipping dad disdains him: He's queer. He comes clean to his quarterback-hunk little bro, Nicky (Lea Coco), and the two embark on a My Fair Lady &#151;like heterofying project that climaxes in a chaste hookup with a stripper named Bunny. Hopelessly homo, Dorian finally tells Dad (Steven C. Fletcher ), who boots him out. Dorian heads to NYU , where he falls in love and hones his witty repartee as tensions simmer back home. An unexpected visit from Nicky ends Dorian's escape-from-upstate fantasy and leads to an epiphany for him. "We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us," wrote Oscar Wilde . In the end, our Dorian suffers from anger, bequeathed to him by Dad, not deities.
