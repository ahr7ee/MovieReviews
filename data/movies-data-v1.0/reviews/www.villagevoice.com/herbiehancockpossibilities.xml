      <text>Herbie Hancock  is looking damn good for a man in his mid sixties, and he's far from set in his ways&#151;the veteran jazzman proved as much on his 2005 duets album Possibilities , on which he teamed up with Christina Aguilera , Annie Lennox , Trey Anastasio , Wayne Shorter , and Sting, among others. This movie tie-in is considerably less innovative than its subject; with its straightforward track-by-track recording-session clips, it feels like something you'd find on the bonus disc of a deluxe package. Only when Hancock plays with Brian Eno  do we get a look back at some of his innovations, like the '80s hit "Rockit," which integrated synth sounds in ways most jazz players might find disturbing. This is primarily a film for fans of all involved.
