      <text>In this era of listless PG-13 horror flicks, it's something of a relief to know that the 1970s-style exploitation shocker still exists, but Chaos  only serves as another depressing reminder of how far the genre has fallen. Two teenage girls on their way to a rave in the middle of nowhere stumble into the den of a gang headed by a drifter named Chaos (Kevin Gage ), leading to various graphic scenes of rape, torture, mutilation, etc. The reference point is obviously Wes Craven 's Last House on the Left , but Chaos  lacks the audience-implicating boldness or howling political outrage of that landmark; where Last House  was provocative, Chaos  is merely disgusting. The movie opens with a message announcing its mission "to educate and, perhaps, save lives"&#151;presumably a joke, although the portrayal of one girl's impossibly naive parents ("Emily was raised with good family values!"), an attempt at social satire so inept as to verge on self-parody, raises some doubt. Other hints of subtext&#151;a cop's racially charged comments, an allusion to Chaos's military past&#151;go nowhere, but the root problem may be that the ultraviolent strategies Craven used so effectively 30 years ago don't work for today's non-shockable horror audience. Still, the film's ending, as nihilistic as Chaos himself, feels depressingly contemporary.
