      <text>There's no disputing the sincerity with which Steven Sawalich  tells the true-life tale of Richard Pimentel , the man more or less behind the Americans with Disabilities Act . His is, without question, a story worth telling: Cocky kid thinks he'll make a great motivational speaker, professor tells him he's "full of shit" and needs to go live a little, kid goes to Vietnam  and nearly dies a lot, then returns home all but deaf&#151;the whole world sounds like it's underwater and populated by a billion whistles being blown at once. And Ron Livingston , deadpan batshit in Office Space  and stoically heroic in Band of Brothers , is the perfect dude for the role; you want  to believe in him. But a little earnestness goes a long way, and Music Within  has a little too much of it, down to the casting of Michael Sheen  (The Queen 's Tony Blair ) as the wheelchair-bound savant with cerebral palsy who acts as Richard's muse and conscience. Sheen, like the movie itself, is trying too hard to inspire when the story doesn't need the help.
