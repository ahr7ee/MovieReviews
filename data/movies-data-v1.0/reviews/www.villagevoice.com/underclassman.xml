      <text>Nope! I'm sorry, this won't do&#151;not the murder-drug-bust plot, not the criminally pabulum high school "antics," not even Tracy "Tre" Stokes, the spunky bike cop turned undercover high schooler played by Nick Cannon . And really, Cannon's damn lucky this 95-minute flick's got 85 minutes of extreme-sports sequences; otherwise he may have had to do more than sleep through his character's trouble-with-authority pageantry. "Critics just don't understand," boy genius might plead, but no, we do, actually: British bliss czars, the doughnut-loving LAPD , and bitchin'-hot Spanish profs, no matter how many, how fat, or how bitchin' hot, can't make up for easy double entendres and zero character development.
