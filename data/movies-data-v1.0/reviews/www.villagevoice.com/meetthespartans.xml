      <text>Mike Judge  predicted this bullshit would happen in his dystopian satire Idiocracy , in which Americans had become so dumb that the multiplex headliner was something called Ass : just two hours of a naked, farting rump. Depressingly, he was off by about 500 years. Here and now, the writing-directing team of Jason Friedberg  and Aaron Seltzer  (see also: Date Movie , Epic Movie ) water down their own blend of pop-comic diarrhea in this witless, tasteless, formless spoof of 300 's homoerotic box-office warriors. So infuriatingly lazy that its leads don't even earn Mad Magazine  &#150;clever nicknames, the movie pits King Leonidas (Sean Maguire ) and his chest-waxed army of 13 against pierced Persian Xerxes (Ken Davitian ), stopping every 30 seconds to make random media references from 2006 through summer 2007: Heroes , Britney's vagina, Ugly Betty  , Paris's vagina, Spider-Man 3 , Lindsay's vagina, repeat ad nauseam. Carmen Electra  proves herself a national treasure as our highest-priced whore, Kevin Sorbo  makes a Herculean fool of himself, testicles are bitten, penguins defecate, the countless man-on-man gags land every time with a "gay is gross" eww response, at least six corporate products are placed&#151;and, at its most offensive, a death cry of "Say hello to Anna Nicole ." I'm moving to Europe.
