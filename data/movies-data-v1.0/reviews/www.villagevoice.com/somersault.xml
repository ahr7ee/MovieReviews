      <text>There are lots of ways to grow up. The method offered in this Australian drama is to do something awful and then flee from it. Heidi (beautiful Abbie Cornish ) gets caught seducing her mother's boyfriend, then almost immediately heads to the bus station. In the mountain ski town of Jinda- byne, she finds a club, dances with the first boy who smiles at her, and heads home with him. The following night, it's a different boy (Sam Worthington ), and this one's a keeper&#151;no doubt because he's difficult, silent, and an alcoholic. When he won't love her, Heidi resorts to the same destructive behavior that drove her from home. Somersault 's dreamy, sexy, rather chilly style captures Heidi's attempt to escape her past, to build something new atop the rubble of what came before, and ultimately to hide it. What she learns is what everyone learns: It can't be done.
