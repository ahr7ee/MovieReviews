      <text>In his big-screen directorial debut, Kevin Bacon  gleefully flaunts wife Kyra Sedgwick 's naked body for all to envy, in what initially plays as a deranged sex comedy about a woman so desperate to be pregnant that she maximizes the odds at every opportunity. Once that's achieved, Bacon the director indulges his wife, letting her play crazy and emotional in a showy performance that screams "serious actress." The film focuses on single-mom Emily (Sedgwick), whose parents were such narcissistic, nymphomaniac pricks that she's determined to be the opposite, and becomes a selfless mother to the point of derangement&#151;culminating in an incident that's perhaps a wee bit over-the-top. Bacon himself appears in flashback as Emily's father, and the couple's real-life daughter plays young Emily, who, in the movie's best scene, belts out an impressive a cappella rendition of David Bowie 's "Life on Mars."
