Jared Leto  might win an Oscar next year if audiences are willing to look at Chapter 27  as an abstract of the rise to power of Perez Hilton , but Jarrett Schaefer 's film is explicitly about the mental unraveling of John Lennon  murderer Mark David Chapman , a role for which Leto gained 60 pounds and unintentionally invoked the voice of South Park 's Towelie. "I'm going to be with you, Holden . . . in the rye . . . in the ryyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeee," drawls the actor in a seemingly pot-stoked stupor, laying on the crazy so thick you're left wondering why Chapman was let off the plane from Hawaii . Making the Fincherian The Killing of John Lennon  seem like the masterpiece Zodiac  wasn't, this misbegotten psychological portrait eagerly foregrounds Leto's excess blubber and histrionic blather, delivered like bad improv outside the Dakota building—"home of the great and powerful," according to Chapman, clearly oblivious that Rex Reed  also lives inside. A retarded sense of meta is achieved whenever Leto's Chapman goes on about the phony theatrics of film actors, but it's Lindsay Lohan , as über–Lennon fan Jude, who breaks your heart, looking convincingly horrified that she has three undeserved Razzies  while Leto has none.
