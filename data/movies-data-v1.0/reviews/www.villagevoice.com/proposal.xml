      <text>Starring Sandra Bullock  as the publishing-house boss who blackmails her assistant, played by Ryan Reynolds , into marrying her, lest she face deportation to Canada, this is nothing but a faint echo of its myriad predecessors, which are too numerous to name. You know every tinny beat and false note by heart, from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish. The Proposal , in fact, appears to have been written using a secret cache of computers stored beneath Walt Disney  HQ since 1978—codename "Pete Chiarelli ," the first-time screenwriter who receives credit for having pilfered every rom-com convention since the invention of breathing. (It was directed by Anne Fletcher , who stitched together 27 Dresses  out of the leftover scraps not used here.) Or, perhaps, it's the product of a book of MadLibs in which spaces are left blank for The Handsome Male Ingénue Specializing in Cocked Eyebrows, The Former Rom-Com It-Girl on Comeback Trail Who Looks 10 Years Younger Than Her Age, and The Ex–Golden Girl  as Dirty-Minded Grandmother. Already filled in: Craig T. Nelson  and Mary Steenburgen  as The Parents and Malin Akerman  as The One Who Got Away. And there you have it: HBO  instaclassic! "Here comes the bride," utters the poster's tagline. Genius. Such great minds.
