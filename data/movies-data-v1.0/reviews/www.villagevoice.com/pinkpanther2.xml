There are maybe two or three laugh-out-loud moments and a handful of chuckles to be culled from Steve Martin &#146;s overlong Pink Panther 2, the latest installment in the lackluster overhaul of Blake Edwards  and Peter Sellers &#146;s iconic Pink Panther comedy franchise. That&#146;s as good as it gets. After several of the world&#146;s most important cultural artifacts are stolen, Inspector Clouseau  (a lifelessly mugging Martin) is drafted to head up a who&#146;s-who of the world&#146;s leading detectives to track down the culprit. Until that storied team comes together, the film is a dreary checklist of pratfalls, wan double entendres, and frantic, unfunny set pieces. Jolts of inspiration briefly appear in the forms of a dick-waving Andy Garcia  and a verbally jousting Alfred Molina  (each playing a detective), and Lily Tomlin  as a counselor trying to turn the casually racist and sexist Clouseau into a model of political correctness. The rest of the cast (Emily Mortimer , Jeremy Irons , a disarmingly beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan ) is fine, but it&#146;s Garcia, Molina, and Tomlin who give you momentary hope that the film might settle into a witty, irreverent romp. Unfortunately, their efforts are ultimately defeated by Harald Zwart &#146;s inert direction of a flat script. And you&#146;ll have no problem figuring out the villain long before the film ends.
