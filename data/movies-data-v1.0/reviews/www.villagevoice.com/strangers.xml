Suggesting an American remake of David Moreau  and Xavier Palud 's Them, The Strangers  is practically an abstraction: an old-school spooker spun from the blood splatter on a wall, a nearby record player scratching an oldie, a CB radio in the garage, a creaky swing set in the backyard. First-time helmer Bryan Bertino  is beholden to genre quota, skidding the relationship of pretty young couple Kristen and James (played by Liv Tyler  and Scott Speedman ) before subjecting them to an after-dark home invasion. But he offers no profound rationale for why she refuses his marriage proposal; like the shadowy stranger that comes knocking at their door (eerily asking, "Is Tamara home?"), it's something that just happens . What's up with the bemasked ghoulies of the film's title? Why all the door-slamming? Who's Tamara!?! Plying an old-school artistry that begins with a creepy montage of bumblefuck houses and holds up almost without fail until the strangers offer a creepy non-justification for their transgressions, analog-man Bertino teases with the unknown until he's left no pimple ungoosed. Sometimes avoiding the synapse-raping bad habits of splat packers Eli Roth  and Alexandre Aja  is its own reward; doing so without also submitting to Michael Haneke â€“style hand-slapping is nearly monumental.
