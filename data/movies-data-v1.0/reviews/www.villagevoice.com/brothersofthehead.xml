      <text>This mockumentary tracks the rise and fall of a conjoined-twin glam-rock act (played by Luke and Harry Treadaway , with the aid of prosthetics) in polysexual, Performance -era England, but the tone is anything but mocking. Directors Keith Fulton  and Louis Pepe , who made the Terry Gilliam /Don Quixote  doc Lost in La Mancha , avoid Behind the Music  snark, focusing instead on period textures and oddball details (weirdest of all, an aborted Ken Russell  biopic). The golden-hued footage is lovingly faked by ace cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle , and the straight-faced result is as improbably touching as the Farrelly brothers ' underrated Stuck on You .
