Not the Liar Liar  sequel it looks like in the trailer, but close enough: Jim Carrey  plays a self-absorbed Debbie Downer  named Carl Allen  who green-lights every bad decision in an effort to reinvent his sorry life. And, hey, it works! Really well, because his first terrible decision—to give a homeless man all his money—turns out to be a stroke of good fortune, as Carl is rescued by perky, spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel ), a singer in an avant-rock band called Munchausen by Proxy and the instructor of a jogging-photography class. How quirky! Theirs quickly blossoms into a romance defined by its random acts of wackiness, including a flight to Lincoln, Nebraska  . . . just because it's there. Inevitably, Carl winds up in the stands of a Nebraska-Oklahoma football game, his body covered in red and white paint. See what saying "yes" to anything will get you? Turns a 46-year-old man into a frat boy. (See also: Will Ferrell .) After Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and even 2005's Fun With Dick and Jane  remake, Carrey seemed destined for far more grown-up roles; he'd transitioned from the slapshticky surreal to the unexpectedly real. But Yes Man  is nothing more than warmed-over holiday seconds, a repackaged best-of for those who already own the hits.
