      <text>After the deathly dull, faux-hipster muddle that was Ethan Hawke 's directorial debut, Chelsea Walls  , expectations aren't exactly high for the scruffy, pretentious, boho actor's adaptation of his own 1997 novel&#151;about a scruffy, pretentious, boho actor and too-intense Romeo named William (Mark Webber ). But in chronicling the manic euphoria of this 20-year-old's first love and, subsequently, the neurotic despair of his first break-up with aspiring singer-songwriter Sara (Catalina Sandino Moreno ), Hawke quite capably taps into the bittersweet complexities of young, love-struck idiocy (otherwise known as the agonizing path that leads to the romantic realization that boys are dumb, girls are insane, sex isn't everything, and self-destructive obsession is tough to kick). The two meet in a Williamsburg  bar, become inseparable even after she clamps her chastity belt shut, and finally consummate in a sticky, week-long Mexican tryst. After an acting gig keeps him away for a month, Sara passively decides that she's not into boyfriends, and William reacts accordingly: He stalks her. It's achingly sincere, which isn't to say that Hawke's Tennessee Williams &#150;quoting, overwrought script isn't as purple as Prince's rain and littered with dramatic shortcuts (both lovers have daddy issues). Give the guy some credit, though: When you hit rock bottom with your first feature, the only way to go is up.
