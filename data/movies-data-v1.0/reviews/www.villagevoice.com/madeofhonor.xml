In Made of Honor , Patrick Dempsey  plays a conveniently rich and willfully single serial "fornicator" slowly but surely domesticated by his unspoken love for longtime BFF Hannah  (Michelle Monaghan ), who's on her way to Scotland  to marry Mr. Right Now since Mr. Right's too chickenshit to say boo before her "I do." Which, come to think of it, not only sums up this movie, but more or less half the films in which Dempsey starred between 1987 and 2003, when he was scheduled to headline a Fox TV  series based on the film About a Boy , with Dempsey in the Hugh Grant  role of the conveniently rich and willfully single serial "fornicator" slowly but surely domesticated by his blah, blah, blah. And then, of course, there's the My Best Friend's Wedding  connection. Only the filmmakers and McDreamy have been so up-front about the resemblance between their offering and 1997's threesome that to acknowledge any further similarities would be playing right into their grubby paws. Director Paul Weiland  and the three (!) screenwriters it took to boil down thousands of bad movies into 101 minutes haven't provided this one with a single original thought; it should only entertain those still getting adjusted to the idea of talkies.
