      <text>One year (in movie time) on from the action of 2005's Are We There Yet? , sports memorabilia salesman Nick Persons  (Ice Cube ) has sold his business, launched a magazine, and moved his newlywed bride (Nia Long ) and two foul-tempered stepkids into his cramped Portland apartment&#151;whereupon the unexpected arrival of a bun in the oven prompts a relocation to the bucolic countryside and a too-good-to-be-true fixer-upper that quickly proves to be exactly that. Fans of the first film can rest assured that a change in the director's chair has done little to curb the overall tone of slapstick desperation, as the game-faced Mr. Cube does battle with the forces of nature, power tools, and a raft of risible ethnic caricatures. Reportedly, this is all a remake of the popular 1948 Cary Grant  comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream  House , though I'll be damned if I can remember the scene where Grant chased a CGI raccoon across his roof.
