      <text>Nicole Richie  loyalists are sure to be confounded (along with the rest of us) by Kids in America , the weirdly anti-Bush high school "satire" that is also Richie's big-screen debut. Very loosely based on true stories, this inelegant paean to free speech begins with the hunky but misunderstood Holden Donovan  (Gregory Smith ) getting suspended for a piece of performance art; it then proceeds to rip off every teen flick from Heathers  to Napoleon Dynamite  . Imploring his students to "change 'da world," straight-shooting teach Mr. D (Malik Yoba ) inspires a ragtag band of clich√©s to stand up for Holden and take down their superfine, student-hating principal. Mislaid attempts at topical humor generally fare about as well as this atomic bomb: "Trying to find talent at Booker High is like trying to find weapons of mass destruction in my anus."
