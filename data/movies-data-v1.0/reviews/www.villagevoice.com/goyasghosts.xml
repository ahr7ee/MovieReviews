      <text>Milos Forman  has built his career by pushing the limits of the Hollywood  biopic. Amadeus showed Mozart through the eyes of Salieri; The People vs. Larry Flint   made a porn-pusher look like Jimmy Stewart ; Man on the Moon  hinted that Andy Kaufman  faked his death. One thing Forman has never done with a biopic, though, is not make a biopic. In that respect, if in no other, Goya's Ghosts  breaks new ground. Set in late-18th-century Spain, the drama centers on Goya's muse (Natalie Portman ), the daughter of a wealthy merchant who converted from Judaism. Unfortunately, Portman's picky eating (who doesn't like pork?) leads the Inquisition to condemn her, and it only gets worse when a young priest (Javier Bardem ), in a spectacular example of scholastic logic, takes her request for prayer as an invitation to rape. Not a bad setup, but then the French Revolution sweeps in and mucks everything up. After that, the film takes as many plot-twists as Pirates of the Caribbean ; distinctly Goya in its emphasis on the grotesque, it shows none of the Spaniard's artistic economy.
