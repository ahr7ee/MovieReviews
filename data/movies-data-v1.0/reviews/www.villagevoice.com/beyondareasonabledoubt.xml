      <text>Of his empty, completely unnecessary remake of Fritz Lang 's 1956 thriller, writer-director-cinematographer-producer Peter Hyams  explains in the press notes, "I wanted to make almost a classic film noir, except I wanted it with young people; I didn't want it with grown-ups." Parsed further, "almost a classic film noir" means an especially twisty episode of CSI ; "young people" includes the shirtless gardener from Desperate Housewives   and the ectomorphic doofus who shills for cell phones and Best Buy ; and "grown-ups" equals Michael Douglas  collecting a paycheck. Set in Shreveport , Louisiana, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt  finds ambitious TV reporter C.J. Nicholas  (Jesse Metcalfe ), aided by his smart-aleck colleague (Joel David Moore ), hatching a convoluted plan in which he implicates himself in a murder to prove that a slick D.A. vying for governor (Douglas)—whose assistant (Amber Tamblyn ) is sleeping with C.J.—is manipulating evidence. Lang's film, the last he made in the U.S., exposed the immorality of the death penalty; Hyams's retread offers only more plot and longer, louder car chases. Though she's the youngest of the principals, 26-year-old Tamblyn (as anyone who saw her incredible performance in 2006's Stephanie Daley   can attest) proves she is the only one who can act like an adult.
