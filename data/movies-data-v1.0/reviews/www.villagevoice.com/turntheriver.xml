Kailey (Famke Janssen ) is getting on 40, living in an upstate limbo, driving to NYC for clandestine meetings with the 12-year-old that son her ex-stepmom tries to keep from her. She&#146;s undesirable because she lives off poker and trolling money games at Rip Torn &#146;s underlit, underpopulated pool hall (its drabness accentuated by a sludgy 16mm transfer). When a woman fills a traditionally male role, you&#146;re bound to find strange frictions&#151;scenes around the pool table are fraught as each pocketed ball impacts the egos involved, the tactile threat of imperiled manhood a constant undertone. While buying the freshly exfoliated Janssen as a beer-battered hard case requires suspended disbelief, her low-key treatment beats the ostentatious frowsing-down that&#146;s usually counterfeited for range when a beautiful woman plays &#147;against type.&#148; Writer-director by Chris Eigeman , one of America&#146;s finest comic actors (best showcased in Whit Stillman &#146;s films), seems aware of the risk that his film runs of drifting into the untenable, and so he painstakingly anchors it with double knots of character development, weaving in a network of supporting parts and a real sense of how people support or subvert one another in their screwed-up relationships. Turn the River  can&#146;t weather the ante-upping into pathos when Kailey desperately reasserts her privilege of motherhood&#151;but the sense of storytelling intelligence is undeniable.
