      <text>Overachievement may go down as Justin Lin 's great subject&#151;if only he weren't a superlative case study. First his muddled Goodfellas  satire Better Luck Tomorrow  got a pass as a boon to Asian Americans in the movies, and now Annapolis  , his often laughably overwrought rehash of An Officer and a Gentleman , ekes out enough of a subtext on competition to qualify as a non-fiasco. At any rate, this is probably the first time a commanding officer has taunted his recruit with the line "Ooohh, I forgot. You're a wait-lister ." James Franco  is Jake Huard , a low-scoring Annapolis, Maryland , native who escapes a destiny of factory work by joining the navy across the way. Lin once again pushes the issue of minorities to the foreground, but his blunt schematics&#151;Jake's three roommates all have different ethnicities; his superior (Tyrese Gibson ) is black; and his instructor cum love interest (Jordana Brewster ) is a woman&#151;hardly play as gritty realism, and Iraq 's absence from the equation seems flat-out craven. Eventually, Jake's desire to make it in the academy boxing championship transforms Annapolis  into a pugilist picture, with Jake forced to swallow his pride and ask girly Brewster to train him. It's a marginally subversive moment in a movie that otherwise falls in line.
