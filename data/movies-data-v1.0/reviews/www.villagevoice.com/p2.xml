      <text>After being KO'd in the underground parking garage of her Manhattan office building, Angela (Rachel Nichols ), a workaholic executive, wakes to find herself chained to a table. It's Christmas Eve, the building's empty, and a sad-eyed security guard named Thomas (Wes Bentley ) wants a little company. Angela quickly makes her escape, only to find herself trapped in the multi-level parking garage, with her suddenly angry lothario in hot pursuit. If it weren't for two excessively violent deaths, P2  could be termed a refreshingly old-fashioned thriller, one dependent on hairbreadth escapes and the pluck of its heroine. Take out those unnecessary moments of gore and you'd have a silly (can't Angela just pull the fire alarm?) but diverting little movie, one driven by a commanding performance from Nichols, a pale beauty whose resemblance to a young Sissy Spacek  has been playfully accentuated by blood streaks and a Carrie-like cream dress. Regrettably, writer-director Franck Khalfoun  (who wrote the script with High Tension  director Alexandre Aja ) appears to have neglected Bentley. The actor, who got his break as the son in American Beauty , doesn't appear to have been told that a good cat-and-mouse thriller needs a villain who whispers menacingly, not one who stomps his foot and shouts hysterically.
