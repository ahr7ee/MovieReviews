      <text>Next to nothing is known about what actually passed between Jane Austen  and Irish lawyer Tom Lefroy , but that hasn't stopped director Julian Jarrold  (Kinky Boots ) from working up a head of romantic steam about their encounter. If you're an Austen reader, you can have an OK time just playing I Spy Pride and Prejudice , as friends and family in Becoming Jane  morph slyly into the novel's characters. But the job at hand is to give Austen (a pretty good, if giggly, Anne Hathaway ) the lively romantic life (with the excellent James McAvoy ) she probably never had&#151;and why not, since that's what she did herself in her novels? Following a delicious (if improbable) flirtatious exchange in which Lefroy lets Jane  know that all she really needs is nookie, Becoming Jane  turns into a presentable Harlequin romance, with hurdle after hurdle succeeded by an eleventh-hour turnaround. I'm grateful that the real-life Austen was freed to write her own superior romances, but I wept like a baby when love lay bleeding on the ground.
