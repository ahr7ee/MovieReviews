      <text>Baby, look at me . Gone are Leroy&#146;s cornrows, short-shorts, and leg warmers: The anodyne adolescents in 25-year-old Kevin Tancharoen &#146;s directorial debut (written by Allison Burnett ) suggest not the charismatic, street-smart pupils at Performing Arts, but the Up with People squares. Don&#146;t you know who I am?  Like all good drama queens, the students in Alan Parker &#146;s 1980 original, which unfolded during an unmistakably Koch-era New York, take up space (blocking traffic on West 46th Street) and disrespect authority (dropping f-bombs in class, smashing school property). They also do drugs, have sex (and abortions, if necessary), and stay up past midnight. The new class at P.A. is strictly PG, sharing a chummy coffee with the vocal instructor (Megan Mullally ) who takes them on a karaoke field trip to Lucky Cheng&#146;s, where not one drag queen is visible. Light up the sky like a flame . Though his gayness was awkwardly shoehorned in, carrot-topped Montgomery  was at least undeniably out in Parker&#146;s film. His closest analogue&#151;many of the kids in the remake are race and/or gender inversions of the original characters&#151;merely alludes to homo-leanings through emo, Efron-esque bangs and a slightly swish carriage. Members of the class of &#146;80 struggled to stay in school despite homelessness and crime; the greatest crisis in &#146;09 finds a student&#146;s Sesame Street   work-schedule affecting her GPA. The sanitized moppets in the new Fame  sing the body generic.
