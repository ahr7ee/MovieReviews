In October 2001, a Fort Worth , Texas, nurse's aide named Chante Mallard  struck 37-year-old Gregory Glenn Biggs with her 1997 Chevy Cavalier , lodging him in her windshield; she allowed him to remain there, and he died two hours later despite his desperate pleas for help. It's become the stuff of urban legend—this story of the woman who tried to ditch the body and burn the car to destroy the remnants of her horrific crime before she was sentenced to prison for 50 years. Hell of a true-life tale, which gets the extended remix from Re-Animator 's Stuart Gordon . Stuck  is both darkly comic and disgusting; the name alone reduces the crime to a sick joke. Mena Suvari  plays the Mallard stand-in as mean and empty—she'd rather fuck her boyfriend than help the dying man in her garage. Stephen Rea  is Biggs , more or less; he's older than the real guy, but still a broken-down, jobless mess wandering the streets when he gets tagged, almost begging to be put out of his misery. Gordon, of course, has taken substantial liberties with the story: The filmmaker wants revenge on the perpetrator, something more than just jail time. Still, he's got plenty of nasty laughs for those unwilling to see deeper into the bleak, tragic darkness; every dog finds a bone, turns out—you'll see.
