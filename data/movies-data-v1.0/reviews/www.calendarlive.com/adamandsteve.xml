      <text>         Much of Craig Chester's good-hearted love story "Adam &amp; Steve" is silly and contrived, but the film boasts four engaging actors, including Chester. In 1987, a shy goth kid, Adam (Chester), and a go-go dancer, Steve (Malcolm Gets), meet at a Manhattan disco and experience a disastrously aborted one-night stand. Years later they cross paths and, not recognizing each other, fall in love. Crucial to their story are their best friends, Adam's pal Rhonda (Parker Posey), a comedian who has lost her inspiration, and Steve's cynical straight roommate Michael (Chris Kattan). Chester's humor is decidedly hit-and-miss, but he's a shameless heart-tugger.
