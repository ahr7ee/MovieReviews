  These 'Deeds' are hardly imaginative
 
Recycling is alive but not well in the outmoded teen comedy "Dirty Deeds," with a result that is more toxic than intoxicating. Employing such staples of the genre as actors years older than the characters they play, moronic authority figures and Scatology 101 jokes, the film strings them together in a nearly laugh-free environment, rehashing such totally '80s fare as "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "Risky Business" and "The Last American Virgin."
 
  TV heartthrob Milo Ventimiglia ("The Gilmore Girls") stars as Zach, a too-cool-for-school senior who takes on West Valley High's notorious Dirty Deeds â€” 10 pranks passed down through the ages that must be completed in a 12-hour period the night before the big homecoming rally. Aided and abetted by the super-serious valedictorian (Lacey Chabert), her freshman brother (Wes Robinson) and a homeless man (Todd Zeile), Zach does battle with the school's star quarterback, Dan (Matthew Carey), and a Neanderthal named Riplock (Alex Solowitz). Written by Jon Land and Jonathan Thies and directed by sitcom veteran David Kendall, the first project by former baseball player Zeile's Green Diamond Entertainment proves that independent filmmakers are every bit as capable of turning out mindless and soulless product as the film-by-committee studios.
 
 "Dirty Deeds,"
 rated PG-13 for crude humor, sexual content, language, teen partying/drug references and some violence. Running time: 1 hour, 27 minutes. In general release.
