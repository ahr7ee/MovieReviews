      <text>         An initially promising horror film that turns exploitive, "Wolf Creek" fails to deliver the requisite payoff considering its leisurely pace. It bears the almost always dubious label "based on true events," and details the unfortunate fate that befalls two young British women, Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi), visiting Australia, and the local bloke, Ben (Nathan Phillips), they hook up with for a road trip across the inhospitable outback.
 
  Writer-director Greg McLean admirably attempts to breathe some life into the genre by taking his time to get to the gore, but rather than yielding interesting characters it merely deflates the suspense. The ambling first half follows the trio as they make their way to isolated Wolf Creek Crater, and though the actors are appealing enough, their characters remain ciphers. It's difficult to care one way or another whether they win the lotto, get abducted by aliens or are cut to ribbons by a homicidal Samaritan.
