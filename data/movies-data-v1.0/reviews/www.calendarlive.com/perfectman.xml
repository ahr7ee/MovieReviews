         In "The Perfect Man," the moon exists "to remind us that each day has the potential for beauty." This according to Jean (Heather Locklear), a fancy-cake baker and single mother of two who would be better off remembering that each day has the potential for medication. Jean is a serial monogamist with a penchant for losers. Every time one dumps her, she picks up the family and moves. Spastic parenting calls for drastic measures, so when newly installed in Brooklyn (where everyone sounds exactly like Fran Drescher), Jean's daughter Holly (Hilary Duff) smells another bad egg in the person of Lenny the Styx-loving baker (Mike O'Malley) and decides to play e-Cyrano. Inventing a perfect man for Jean to fall for sight unseen, she models him on her friend's uncle, Ben (Chris Noth), the kind of sexy, warm restaurant owner who always has time for inquisitive 10th graders during the lunch rush. Holly gets so caught up writing Jean love e-mails in an effort to prevent her from marrying Lenny that she overlooks her own perfect boy, Adam (Ben Feldman), a cute artist who lets Holly commandeer his computer for her e-charade. Then she spends each wistful night confiding it all to her online diary. Sure, it all sounds like a stretch, but Jean is just crazy enough for it to work â€” the plan, that is, not the movie. The movie is a tortured marshmallow. It's too disingenuous for teens (at least the teens sitting behind me at the screening, who kept howling, "Where's the moooon?") and too mommy's-going-on-Match.com-again disturbing for younger viewers. Seriously, the perfect man would call social services.
 
 "The Perfect Man": 
PG for some mildly suggestive content. It suggests that mom gets around. 1 hour, 40 minutes. In general release.
