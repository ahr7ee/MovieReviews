Working his way through the Z-movie pantheon of '70s exploitation subgenres, rocker-filmmaker Rob Zombie transitions from house of horrors homage to serial killer road movie with this crass, vacuous exercise in grind-house stylistics.
 
  As in his 2003 feature debut, "House of 1000 Corpses," the director borrows from numerous films, embellishing them with his own bizarre sense of deluded grandeur.
 
    Though the genre-hopping director maintains that this is not a sequel, "The Devil's Rejects" does continue the exploits of the psychopath stars from the first movie, the Firefly family, whose members are inexplicably named for Groucho Marx characters.
 
  From the stylized freeze-frames that end most sequences to the overly familiar climax that references so many films there should be footnotes, "Rejects" feels like 100% regurgitation, minus whatever protein that may have existed in the originals.
