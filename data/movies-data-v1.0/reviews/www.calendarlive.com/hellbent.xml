  Clever horror set at WeHo event
 
Paul Etheredge-Ouzts' imaginative and witty "HellBent" unleashes a serial slasher amid a WeHo Halloween carnival. Focusing on roommates Eddie (Dylan Fergus), Joey (Hank Harris), Chaz (Andrew Levitas) and Tobey (Matt Phillips), "HellBent" moves restlessly in and out of bars and into the streets thronged with costumed revelers, where lurking in the shadows is a bare-to-the-waist man wearing a metallic, horned mask and wielding a scythe. The result is a hard-charging horror movie with a clever gay twist.
