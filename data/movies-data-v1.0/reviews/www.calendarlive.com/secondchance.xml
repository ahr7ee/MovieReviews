      <text>         Christian music star Michael W. Smith makes his feature film acting debut as an associate pastor at a mega-church who serves a reluctant apprenticeship at an urban church, in the prosaic drama "The Second Chance." A movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class, the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry.
 
  Smith plays Ethan Jenkins, who has turned away from a drug habit and successful music career to work for his father, Jeremiah (J. Don Ferguson), the head of a plush suburban congregation known as the Rock. The Rock still manages and finances Jeremiah's original ministry, Second Chance Community Church, now run by his protégé, brash former basketball player Jake Sanders (jeff obafemi carr). After a couple of pastoral miscues, Jeremiah sends Ethan to "watch and learn" at Second Chance, where the younger Jenkins clashes with Jake.
 


         






    Smith won't be adding Oscars to his Grammys anytime soon, but he acquits himself well enough opposite the more formidable carr. "Second Chance" was written by Chip Arnold, Ben Pearson (who also served as director of photography) and Steve Taylor, directed by Taylor.
