 'Daltry Calhoun' fails to take root
 
In the parlance of "The Player," Katrina Holden Bronson's "Daltry Calhoun" would be pitched as "Because of Winn-Dixie" meets "Napoleon Dynamite," and that is definitely not a good thing. This aimless satire stars Johnny Knoxville as the title character, a ne'er-do-well who abandons his girlfriend, May (Elizabeth Banks), and their infant child, then inexplicably becomes a sod mogul by developing a successful cannabis-based turf for golf courses. Years later, when May shows up with 14-year-old daughter June (Sophie Traub), a music prodigy with designs on getting into Juilliard, Daltry's business is tanking due to an aberration in his seed.
 
  Bronson attempts to wring some unearned emotional redemption from her dimwitted characters, but the faux-Southern sincerity and June's incessant voice-over prove too annoying. The film benefits from an eclectic alt-country soundtrack that includes, over the end credits, an intriguing mash-up of Marty Robbins' "Utah Carol" and the Wu-Tang Clan's "A Better Tomorrow."
 
 "Daltry Calhoun,"
 PG-13 for sexual content, drug material and language. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. At the ArcLight Cinemas, 6360 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 464-4226.
