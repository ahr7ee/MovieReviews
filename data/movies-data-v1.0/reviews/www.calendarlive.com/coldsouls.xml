A comedy that has lots of souls

Somewhere between the rabbit-hole absurdist comedy of Charlie Kaufman and a navel-gazing Woody Allen film is the somberly humorous indie "Cold Souls" from writer-director Sophie Barthes. Inspired by Jungian writings, moody sci-fi and today's meta-approach to celebrity, Barthes cast bug-eyed, heroically slumped actor Paul Giamatti as himself, a noted thespian stymied by an inner turmoil that's derailing his rehearsals for "Uncle Vanya," which leads him to a company whose founder (David Strathairn) claims to be able to unburden people by extracting the soul, and/or implanting someone else's. (Not missing a chance for a good sight gag, the film reveals Giamatti's soul to look like a chickpea.) 

This quaintly goofy premise makes for pointedly neurotic "Sleeper"-ish fun, not to mention nifty digs at our culture of self-reinvention.

But Barthes has Andrei Tarkovsky in mind too, namely in a parallel storyline involving a trafficker named Nina (a haunting Dina Korzun) who uses her body as a mule to import the black-market-sold souls of poor Russians. Combining elements of naturalism, poetic tragedy and dry wit, Barthes shows a patient intelligence often missing from today's scrappier filmmakers, and she makes wonderful use of the gifted Giamatti, one of our more entertaining depressives, who thankfully avoids a wink-wink turn. Although "Cold Souls" can at times feel like a clever short film too thinly feature-ized, at least its brain isn't the size of a chickpea.
