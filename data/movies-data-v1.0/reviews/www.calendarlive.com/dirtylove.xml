  'Dirty Love' is a cinematic low
 
Attention, Razzie voters.
 
  As arbiters of the awful in the cinematic realm, it is your solemn duty to subject yourselves to the inept, execrable comedy "Dirty Love." It will surely yield nominations for worst picture, director (John Asher), screenplay (Jenny McCarthy), actress (McCarthy, again), supporting actress (Kam Heskin and Carmen Electra) and supporting actor (Victor Webster). McCarthy continues her one-woman crusade to prove that former Playboy playmates can be just as unfunny as nonsurgically enhanced women, starring as a photographer bent on revenge against her cheating boyfriend.
 
  It's a sad state of affairs when you feel sorry for Eddie Kaye Thomas (the "American Pie" quartet) because he's working in material that is beneath him.
 
 "Dirty Love,"
 R for strong sexuality, crude humor, language and some drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In general release.
