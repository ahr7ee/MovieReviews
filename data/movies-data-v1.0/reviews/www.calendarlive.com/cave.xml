Diverting rather than outright scary, "The Cave" is nonetheless a furiously paced sci-fi horror adventure featuring virtuoso cinematography and editing that give the film visual panache. Cole Hauser heads a team of cave explorer/deep sea divers who investigate a vast and treacherous cavern in Romania, full of immense, eerily beautiful chambers, impossibly narrow passages, steep cliffs, rushing rapids and waterfalls. This is the awesome realm of the unknown, and danger lurks everywhere, especially from ever-evolving micro-ecologies, which have actually been discovered in caves in Romania and elsewhere.
 
  Consequently, there is a kernel of scientific basis for the unexpected, albeit exaggerated, challenges awaiting Hauser's team. Directed with admirable energy and clarity by Bruce Hunt and crisply acted, "The Cave" is a polished and ambitious production, and its makers don't lose sight of their primary goal to generate thrills and chills. It's increasingly hard to work up a fright on the screen these days, but even if "The Cave" doesn't exactly terrify, it's fun and looks great.
 
   "The Cave,"
 rated PG-13 for intense creature violence. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. In general release.
