 Kid holds English drama captive
 
Written by Alison Hume and directed by Gillies MacKinnon, "Pure" is an alternately sentimental and brutal tale of a 10-year-old boy (Harry Eden) struggling to rescue his widowed mother (Molly Parker) from heroin addiction. This is a conventional, well-acted, English working-class drama in the familiar realist style, but it does not attain anywhere near the level of artistry and imagination of a Ken Loach film. Although deeply felt on the part of its makers, "Pure" is manipulative on the one hand and at times defies credibility on the other. Nonetheless, Eden, who holds the film together by his winning presence and doughty performance, effectively conveys the effect of severe challenges that no child should ever have to face. With David Wenham, Geraldine McEwan, Karl Johnson, Vinni Hunter and Keira Knightley.
