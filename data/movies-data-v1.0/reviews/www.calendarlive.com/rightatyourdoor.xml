         The ongoing attractiveness of our metropolis as a disaster mecca for filmmakers reaches a draggy low with the hysteria-steeped indie "Right at Your Door." Only this time, the focus isn't on the Jack Bauers of the world, but on one childless couple whose home is perilously close to the site of a dirty bomb attack that hits downtown L.A. (not to mention Beverly Hills and LAX) and starts blanketing the sky with a mysterious toxic ash. Jobless Brad (Rory Cochrane) openly fears for the whereabouts of his working wife Lexi (Mary McCormack) as he seals himself inside their house, then refuses to let her in when she shows up alive, afraid and -- oops -- coughing. With this annoying bit of false conflict -- who denies a loved one entry on the day of the apocalypse? -- first-time writer/director Chris Gorak keeps a tight camera on his leads as they worry, yell and cry at each other through duct-taped plastic sheets while radio voices bleat vague distress details. We never hear news reporting, though, on what the germ's spread is actually doing to civilians, since that would undermine the lame, bluntly moralizing shocker Gorak has planned for the end. A dumb twist can be excused, however, if your characters keep the thing afloat, which makes perhaps the most unforgivable sin of this claustrophobic terror scenario the fact that we have to spend it with arguably the two least interesting people in Los Angeles.
