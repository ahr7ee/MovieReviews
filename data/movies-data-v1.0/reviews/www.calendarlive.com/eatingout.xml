      <text>         Q. Allan Brocka's "Eating Out" is a slight sex comedy that would work far better on stage than screen, where it seems far too talky and too slow. Brocka would have us believe that Scott Lunsford's Caleb, a Tucson college student, who is notably handsome and unpretentious, just can't get a girl. Caleb is attracted to Gwen (Emily Stiles), who is attracted to gays, so Caleb's gay roommate Kyle (Jim Verraros) suggests that Caleb come on to Gwen's gay roommate Marc (Ryan Carnes). Kyle figures that this will make Gwen attracted to Caleb, and that they will eventually get together, which will allow Kyle to pursue Marc himself. If it were briskly staged under a proscenium, "Eating Out" might just make it as an amusing trifle, but on the big screen it's merely tedious and silly.
