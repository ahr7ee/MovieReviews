      <text>         If it's small and British, it must be an inspirational working-class drama in the vein of "The Full Monty" and "Billy Elliot." Gaby Dellal's "On a Clear Day" tells the story of Frank Redmond (Peter Mullan), a Glasgow shipbuilder who decides to swim the English Channel after being laid off.
 
 Since suffering a tragedy two decades earlier, gruff Frank hovers at an emotional remove from his sweet wife, Joan (Brenda Blethyn), and his sensitive stay-at-home-dad son, Rob (Jamie Sives), who consistently rebuffs his father's awkward attempts at rapprochement. What's a man to do if his son won't have coffee with him and his wife has a secret? Tackle a vast, frigid metaphor, that's what.
 


         






   After a few dispiriting attempts at finding employment, Frank turns to local fish and chips merchant Chan (Benedict Wong) and his shipyard friends Eddie (Sean McGinley), Norman (Ron Cook) and son-figure Danny (Billy Boyd) to help him train. To them, at least, he's a hero. Sweet-natured, if somewhat familiar, "On a Clear Day" features fine performances by Mullan, Blethyn and Sives. Dellal and cinematographer David Johnson paint an inviting picture of Glasgow.
