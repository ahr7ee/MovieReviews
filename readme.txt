The main file is DocAnalyzer.java in the analyzer package.
To select a movie, the console will prompt you to enter one of the predefined titles that it prints out.
Any other response will cause the program to exit.
The program may take a few minutes to run.
Some of the other files such as Post.java and the JSON files are unused.
Thank you.
